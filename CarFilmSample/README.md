# CarFilmSample

I created this project to support my dissertation, "On Location in Nature's Studio: Toward a Social History of Hollywood Filmmaking in the American West." My final chapter dealt with the relationship between location shooting and transportation, so I developed this model to detect cars to measure the frequency of their appearance in Hollywood films. I have expanded my sample after completing the dissertation, but the original sample is available under "releases."
