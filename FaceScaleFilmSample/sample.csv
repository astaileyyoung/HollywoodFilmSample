Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and Marjorie had first met. Meanwhile, their relationship deepens (though, consistent with '50s Hollywood mores, the more full-fledged sexuality in their relationship is never explicitly communicated). They plan to marry, but after the musical's critical failure on Broadway, Noel runs away. Marjorie finally tracks him down at the summer theater where they first met--and, realizing that this is probably where he belongs, finally gives up on the relationship. Helping her to move on with her life is Wally, once Noel's assistant, now a very successful Broadway playwright, and all along, Marjorie's unrequited lover. The movie ends with a clear implication Wally and Marjorie will finally be a couple.",,0.0298364908503767,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/marjorie-morningstar_1958_51911.csv

The lusty Fyodor Karamazov, a bit of a cad who has lived off the wealth of his long deceased first wife, has never loved any of his four now adult sons, including his illegitimate epileptic son, Pavel Smerdjakov, who he employs as his personal servant. The four brothers were largely raised apart. Alexi, the youngest, is the only one who loves his father, but does so as he loves all mankind in his piety. Second eldest Ivan, who lives most of the time in Moscow working in the newspaper business, is the emotionally troubled one. And the eldest Dmitri, an army lieutenant and the only offspring on Fyodor's first wife, knows that he is most like their father, and as such has the greatest animosity toward him in their mutual depravity. Dmitri has knowingly racked up gambling debts in waiting for what he considers his fair share of his mother's wealth, something that Fyodor will not willingly give to him but will loan on a request by request basis which now does not include paying for Dmitri's gambling debts. As a matter of circumstance, Dmitri gets engaged to a virtuous young woman named Katya, for both as a matter of honor, although Katya mistakes that honor for love. The situation between all members of the Karamazov family becomes more complex when Fyodor takes measures to make it more difficult for Dmitri, who meets tavern owner Grushenka in the process. Dmitri falls in love with Grushenka and eventually wants to become an honorable man in all aspects of his life for her, their relationship despite Fyodor himself having asked her previously to marry him.",,0.0450090493601463,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-brothers-karamazov_1958_51435.csv

Their marriage agreement has them consummating their marriage on her 20th birthday, which is in three days, and she's not looking forward to it. But she does taunt him and other men with her overt ""baby doll"" sexuality, fostering the baby-doll aspect by sleeping in a crib in their house's nursery. Baby Doll's now-deceased father allowed the marriage on the stipulation that Archie Lee provide Baby Doll financial security as displayed by the most resplendent house in the south. They currently live in a dilapidated mansion with her Aunt Rose Comfort, and although Archie Lee is making some renovations on it, he no longer has the financial means to make it what Baby Doll wants as his cotton-ginning competitor, the recently-arrived Sicilian Silva Vacarro who runs the cotton plantation syndicate, has effectively put him and many others in the area out of business. The Meighans' fortunes could change after Vacarro's cotton gin burns down in a case of arson. Vacarro is certain Archie Lee is the arsonist. After meeting the Meighans and learning more about their marriage, Vacarro believes the way to get what he wants is through Baby Doll. This action begins the three-way battle of wills among Vacarro, Archie Lee, and Baby Doll.",,,

Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin Miriam Deering has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion.

During his tenure in the village of Quantano, he fought hard to keep his flock of parishioners, in spite of threats and intimidation from the part of local bandit Anacleto Comachi (Sir Dirk Bogarde) and his men. The atheistic bandit has imposed his tyrannical rule over the region for many years. The local Police cannot find any witnesses to come forward and testify to any wrongdoing from the part of Anacleto. Therefore, they cannot charge him or arrest him. The Catholic Church replaces Father Gomez with a younger, more energetic priest, Father Keogh (Sir John Mills) from Ireland. Before departing the village, Father Gomez warns Father Keogh of the dangers of defying Anacleto Comachi's authority. But Father Keogh openly defies the bandit and administers his daily priestly duties at the village church. He even manages to persuade some of the villagers to start attending church again. In retaliation, Anacleto tries to intimidate the priest by starting to murder the villagers in alphabetical order. He also plans a few attempts on the priest's life. Coming between them, Locha (Myl√®ne Demongeot), the beautiful daughter of the major local landowner, brings a bit of reason, sanity, and innocence to this violent world. Anacleto promises to Father Keogh to mend his ways and embrace religion if Father Keogh can persuade him that it's the religious message and teachings, not the personality and charisma of the priest that drives the faith. Father Keogh accepts the challenge and invites Anacleto to live with him and read the Bible.

After voluntarily leaving a dancing gig due to a dispute with the troupe's leading lady, that gig which brought him to the US, he needed to work a series of odd jobs before movie director Bill King discovered him working as a taxi dancer/gigolo in an upscale dance club.

One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work.

Despite his success rate largely from support of the Irish immigrant population in seeing one of their own doing good, Frank does have his detractors, not only the blue bloods of the town, but those that see him operating under an old boys network of doing favors for friends and every one of his actions having a self-serving political motivation. And there are others, including Frank's son, Frank Skeffington, Jr., who couldn't care less about politics, Jr. absorbed with his own fun-loving existence. A microcosm of the political division can be seen by the Caulfield household: non-political Adam Caulfield, a sportswriter for the Morning News newspaper and Frank's nephew, supports his uncle in liking him both as a man and uncle, while Adam's wife, Maeve Caulfield, has the same impression of Frank as her wealthy father, Roger Sugrue, who grew up in the same working class neighborhood as Frank and who sees Frank working on graft. Adam's boss, the Morning News Publisher and Editor-in-Chief Amos Force, has always opposed Frank, and mounts a concerted campaign for those in the anti-Frank camp to rally around his strongest opponent, political neophyte Kevin McCluskey, despite McCluskey's inexperience showing at every turn. As he can see the times changing in terms of the way political campaigns are run and covered with the onset of more electronic media such as television and radio playing a bigger part, Frank brings in Adam as an observer journalist of his campaign to witness the changing times, what Frank sees as his last hurrah before his means of operation to win elections will no longer suffice.",,0.0114244409572381,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-last-hurrah_1958_51845.csv

The other three are physician Dr. Robert Fortness, a struggling actress with the stage name Binky Gay, and loud-mouthed salesman Eddie Hoke, who is both quick with a joke and quick to show off a photograph of his beautiful wife, Marie. Two of them confess to David having painful reckonings waiting for them in Los Angeles. Dr. Fortness, an alcoholic, is returning to own up to his responsibility for a car accident in which his friend and two others were killed, and his guilt over letting his wife Claire lie for him, which destroyed their marriage and alienated his son. Binky, who has tried and failed to realize success on the New York stage for the past year, is returning to her husband, Mike Carr, hoping to keep his affection despite his overbearing mother, former vaudeville star Sally Carr, who still basks in her former but no longer shining glory, and who resents Binky as competition on and off stage. David feels compelled to help their families come to terms with their losses, especially in the case of Dr. Fortness, who hired David as his attorney. Each case is different. The doctor's wife and son need to face the truth. Binky's mother-in-law thinks she knows everything and won't let David get a word in edgewise, so he fools her into thinking that Binky had been successful in New York, only discussing the truth with her husband. Meeting Eddie's widow, David finds that she has more comfort to give him than he has for her. Marie's reminiscence about her marriage to Eddie causes David to reflect on his own marriage, leading him to make a decision.",,0.0465923423423423,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/phone-call-from-a-stranger_1952_45029.csv

This phase of his story begins in 1890. Born into aristocracy, Toulouse-Lautrec moves to Paris to pursue his art as he hangs out at the Moulin Rouge where he feels like he fits in being a misfit among other misfits. His misfit status is due to his diminutive physical stature, his legs which were broken and stopped growing following a childhood fall down some stairs. Because of the way he looks, he believes he is never destined to experience the true love of a woman. That lack of love in his life may change as he meets two women. The first is prostitute Marie Charlet, who he saves from imprisonment in a white knight act. Their relationship ends up being a turbulent one, the downs where each feels the need to hurt the other with their core issues, namely Toulouse-Lautrec's disability and Marie's profession. The second is socialite Myriamme Hayam. In more indirect acts, Toulouse-Lautrec also ends up being her savior, one of those indirect acts being his painting, one which she has purchased, its subject making her reflect on what she sees as the troubles with her own life.",,0.0469077905491699,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/moulin-rouge_1952_44926.csv

Beside passengers, troops and mail the train also carries the latest military invention of Dr. Gatling, the Gatling Gun. Only four such weapons have been assembled and one of them is being sent out West to be tested by Union troops. However, Confederate spies, led by Captain James S. Simmons, of the Georgia volunteers, are well informed regarding the presence of the Gatling Gun on the train. The Confederates, masquerading as Yankees, have set-up an ambush at Greensburg's railway station. When the train stops at Greensburg, the Confederate spies manage to attack and capture the crates containing the disassembled Gatling Gun. After leaving the scene, the Confederate team disperses and only Captain Simmons and Sergeant Guderman carry the Gatling hidden in an elixir salesman's wagon. The two Confederates must cross all Union states undetected and reach Confederate lines with the Gatling Gun. At a river crossing they meet a female doctor in an ambulance wagon that has broken down. The Confederate spies hesitate about helping the Yankee woman for fear of blowing their cover. But the Southern manners win and they decide to help her. They also hide the crates containing the Gatling Gun in her ambulance. In the Yankee town of Baxter Springs they take the doctor and her patient to her home-clinic where they hide the Gatling Gun in a chest in the dinning room. This way they can roam the town without being caught with the Yankee weapon in their possession. They also must find a Confederate sympathizer in town in order to be guided through enemy territory to the Confederate lines. Pretending to be elixir salesmen they sell bottles of muscle-building elixir in town. Arriving in town in a hurry, Union soldiers led by Lt. Braden and assisted by hired Pinkerton's detective Frank Kelso search the region to retrieve the gun. The task of the two Confederate spies has become more difficult, unless they find a contact man who can provide them with information and a guide to take them through Union lines and Indian territory to the nearest Confederate lines.",,0.0185924050632911,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-siege-at-red-river_1954_47488.csv

Ziggy's youthful exuberance disappears when she enters their apartment and finds her mother Natalie (June Duprez) drinking with a strange man. Natalie introduces Ziggy as her ""sister"" and quietly cautions Ziggy against calling her ""mother."" Later, dispensing some motherly advice, Natalie tells Ziggy that if she learns all the tricks, she'll never need to work for a living. Ziggy goes right out and applies parts of this advice by stealing a valuable lapel pin from a fellow high-school student, and is promptly expelled from school. About five years later, Ziggy has made progress and meets Denny Reagan (James Dunn), who persuades her to go into his racket. Ziggy's role is to telephone people who are planning to move and make arrangements to provide a truck to move the furniture. The departing truck is the last that the owners see of their furniture as it is taken to a warehouse and sold by Denny and his gang. Hanging out in a nightclub one evening, circa 1943, the still-underage Ziggy flirts with a young naval officer from Minnesota, Mart Neilson (William Marshall), who promptly falls in love with her and proposes marriage. To ensure that Mart knows her background, Ziggy introduces him to Natalie (at her worst), but Mart still insists on the marriage. Shortly after the wedding ceremony, Mart is shipped out to war-duty and is killed in action. Ziggy learns that she is expecting a baby, while the law catches up to Denny and ships him out to prison. Ziggy is still living with her mother but Natalie, horrified at the prospect of being a grandmother, kicks her out and Ziggy moves into Mrs. Merryman's (Rosalind Ivan) boardinghouse. Ziggy has the baby and some time passes, circa 1944-45, and Ziggy--still making her nightclub rounds--runs into the just-paroled Denny. This Denny is a new-and-thoughtful version, and he does not approve of Ziggy leaving her baby with a sitter while she makes her rounds. Denny shows great interest in the baby and sees more and more of Ziggy. Returning from a date, Ziggy finds the baby's crib vacant. In her absence the babysitter had gone out to her boyfriend's car for some heavy necking and the baby had almost choked to death before being discovered by Mrs. Merryman, who promptly called the police. At the trial, the babysitter denies responsibility (negligence-of-duty) and Ziggy loses custody of her baby. The new-and-thoughtful Denny will have nothing to do with Ziggy, although his mother, knowing that Denny and Ziggy really love each other, tries to bring them together--but Ziggy has disappeared. Having moved to another boardinghouse, she drops by a church and finds an abandoned baby. Denny finds her and the baby sunning in a park and is impressed and thinks she's become the perfect mother. With Denny's help, Ziggy appeals her case to regain custody of her own child, and when the judge learns that she has been caring for an abandoned baby, he is much impressed and returns her own infant to her.",,0.0332953281423804,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/that-brennan-girl_1946_39020.csv

Despite having an auspicious first meeting, Lightcap hires Nora to be his live-in cook and secretary for a week until his manservant Tilney arrives. The third is Joseph, the property's gardener, who is currently laid up with a sprained ankle. In reality, Joseph is Nora's childhood friend Leopold Dilg, who has just escaped from prison. Leopold was being tried for the arson of the factory where he worked, and for murder for the death of the factory foreman Clyde Bracken, whose body was never recovered but who is assumed to have died in the fire. Despite the danger to herself, Nora hides Leopold since she believes his story that although he, as an activist, did speak out about the dangerous conditions at the factory, he did not set the fire, which he assumes was done by the factory's owner, Andrew Holmes, to collect the insurance money, all the while having Leopold as a scapegoat. Nora campaigned to get the job with Lightcap if only to be able to better hide Leopold in the house. Leopold escaped if only because he knew he would not get a fair trial due to the rabble rousing being conducted by Holmes against him.

Nora, Leopold and Leopold's lawyer, Sam Yates, try to get Lightcap involved in helping Leopold by showing him that Leopold indeed will not get a fair trial.

Being single does not bother her as she repeatedly turns down the marriage proposal of Dink's colleague, Professor Joseph Bangs, a man she does not love. So it is with some surprise to her that she not only likes Alan Garroway, a wealthy and handsome industrialist who is doing business with Dink, but that they fall in love and get married after a whirlwind courtship. Alan made his wealth during the war in a family started business which ended up being a parts supplier to the military for their aircraft. In their bi-coastal marriage - Alan's company's headquarters in San Francisco, while he grew up and still owns property in Middleburg, Virginia, outside of Washington, DC where he has many friends in high society - Ann begins to have doubts primarily concerning two aspects. First, she feels out of place in his high society world, and like she is the laughing stock among his friends. He is able to quell her fears about this issue as he acts as her guide to fashion and society behavior. Second, and arguably more important, Ann begins to feel she doesn't really know Alan, mostly as he hid from her the fact that he has a brother, Michael Garroway, from who he is estranged and whose whereabouts he does not know. Michael was once part of the business in its early struggling days, but they parted when Alan caught him stealing from the company. Although she loves and trusts Alan, Ann begins to feel a kinship to what little she learns of Michael through her own investigation, which could place her at odds with Alan, and place her life in potential danger at either the hands of Alan or Michael, which of the two depending on if Alan is telling her the truth about his brother.",,0.0311053470919325,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/undercurrent_1946_39066.csv

Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some ""evening entertainment"" at the German Officers' Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers. First, he asks for volunteers, but only the French entertainer Yvette comes forward. The other five women (American, English, Austalian, Russian and Mexican) stubbornly refuse. Then he shouts at them: ""I say, naturally you'll all volunteer!"" The 16-year-old Australian girl finds her mother as a hard-laborer at the club, they rejoice for a while, but knowing that her pure catholic girl will be ravished that night, Mrs. James kills her daughter instead. Her absence will not be missed much, as two other young women arrive, a Chinese and a Japanese. Soon, the Germans are about to betray the Japanese, but the American is in cahoots with an infiltrated German officer who's really her husband (an OSS spy), the Chinese is trying to make the others believe that Maya is an infiltrated Japanese agent, while Lili herself is seeing a Chinese servant of the Germans in secret, and the women are justly suspicious of Yvette - who is getting fond of the bald-head Colonel Von Meyer... In the end, the American plot is uncovered, the Germans and the Japanese start killing each others, and the fugitive American and Chinese spies. A number of people die in heroic gun-fights. Maya is going to defuse the bombs left in the wine cellar by the escaping Americans, so that the Japanese will get the secret weapon in the end. However Yvette decides to change her loyalty to her country, thinking of what the English girl told her. The two women clash in a desperate fight all over the place, as the fuse is burning - with the future of humankind at stake.",,0.0347794208893485,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/women-in-the-night_1948_40003.csv

The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive.

She is up front about being a woman with a past, she only becoming wealthy and thus glamorous because of the marriage. Her personal solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer refers the case to his colleague Tony Keane. In spending time with Mrs. Paradise in prison, Tony is immediately attracted to her, that attraction which morphs into obsession. As such, Tony does whatever he can to clear her of the charges, either in mounting a defense of suicide, assisted or not, or that someone else killed him, the most likely candidate being the Colonel's trusted valet, Andre Latour, with who Tony initially believes Mrs. Paradise was having an affair. In the process, Tony may be blinded to the evidence as it presents itself. Who can see what is going on is Tony's wife Gay Keane, who not only believes their marriage has been a perfect one up to this point, but that he truly does believe his obsession with Mrs. Paradine being love, which Gay herself does not believe it to be. Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.",,0.043073324742268,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-paradine-case_1947_39694.csv

Caught in a flood of war refugees fleeing Burma, R.A.F. Flight Lieutenant Michael Quinn (Sir Dirk Bogarde) and a fellow Officer are retreating toward the Burma-India border. The disorganized column marching under the intense scorching sun runs into a Japanese ambush. Under a hail of fire, they all scatter in all directions. Quinn and his comrade head for the desert. After a few gruelling hours of walking in the infernal desert, they finally reach a British Army outpost. In 1943, Quinn is sent for a bit of rest and relaxation. He's spending his time skiing in the Indian mountains and relaxing at the New Everest Hotel where his Indian orderly, Bahadur (Marne Maitland), constantly spoils him. Fellow R.A.F. Flying Officer Peter Munroe (John Fraser) shows up at the hotel and informs Quinn that no one is leaving for Britain yet. Munroe also tells Quinn that the two of them have been selected to join a group of British officers who will learn the Japanese language in order to work for Army Intelligence and interrogate Japanese P.O.W.s. Upon their arrival at the Mayfair Hotel in New Delhi, the R.A.F. officers meet other British officers assigned to their language school. Amongst them is the pompous and arrogant R.A.F. Squadron Leader Fenwick (Ronald Lewis), who claims to forego all of the formalities for the sake of friendship, since he's just a fellow student, despite his higher military rank. For their language classes, the officers must travel to the military barracks known as the Red Fort. The man in charge of the language school is a Brigadier General (Anthony Bushell). Their language instructor, Itsumi San (Tadashi Ikeda), is a Japanese man who speaks English and who was released from a British internment camp for enemy aliens to lend a hand. Another Japanese instructor is set to arrive in a few weeks time. When she arrives, young and beautiful Japanese girl ""Sabby"" (Suzuki San) (Y√¥ko Tani) captures everyone's heart and imagination. Many British officers fantasize about dating her, but the lucky one is Flight Lieutenant Michael Quinn. A strong relationship starts developing between Suzuki San and Quinn. Unfortunately, many British still view her as a Japanese enemy. Can her relationship with Michael Quinn blossom, thrive, and survive?",James H.

Bonnie is fascinated with Clyde's criminal past, and his matter-of-factness and bravado in talking about it. Clyde sees in Bonnie someone sympathetic to his goals. Although attracted to each other physically, a sexual relationship between the two has obstacles. They decide to join forces to embark on a life of crime, holding up whatever establishments, primarily banks, to make money and to have fun. They don't plan on hurting anyone or killing despite wielding loaded guns. They amass a small gang of willing accomplices, including C.W. Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. After that, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them. Of the many people they encounter in their crime spree, the one who may have the most profound effect on their lives is Texas Ranger, Frank Hamer, who seeks retribution.",,0.0432444051825677,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/bonnie-and-clyde_1967_61418.csv

It's the end of the school year, and some of the older youth are excited about their futures. Beyond that, a small group of those youths are looking most forward to their imminent vacation to Kiev, where they are planning to hike for the four or five days it takes to get there above their planned three days in the city itself. They include: Damian Terasa Simonov, who finished top of his class including getting a scholarship to study at the State University of Kiev in the fall; his girlfriend, Marina Pavlov, the two who will be separated for the year as she finishes her schooling and who plan eventually to reunite in Kiev not only for Marina to go to university as well but for the two to get married; Kolya Simonov, Damian's older, more worldly brother who is a junior officer in the Soviet air corps; Clavdia Kurin, an old fashioned type of girl on who Kolya is sweet; and Grisha Kurin, Clavdia's younger brother. Things change when the Nazis invade the Soviet Union - including the village of the cooperative - first with air strikes then ground troops. While some of the villagers form a guerrilla army hidden in the woods, they led by Kolya and Damian's father, Boris Stepanich Simonov, Kolya, Damian, Marina, Clavdia, Grisha, and fellow villager, the elderly Karp, are caught between Kiev and the village, all trying to make their way back to the village, except Kolya who must join his regiment at the airfield. Their journey becomes more important to the war effort upon their encounter with someone else on the road. Back in the village, the people who may end up being the most conflicted are: Marina's mother, Sophia Pavlov, who will probably be the primary target of the Nazis as the de facto head of the cooperative, with Marina's father, Rodion Pavlov, having joined the ranks of the guerrillas; and Clavdia and Grisha's grandfather, Dr. Pavel Grigorich Kurin, who as a doctor has vowed to save lives, and who may be asked to save the lives of wounded Nazi soldiers, all the while while the Nazis in similar circumstances have bled the children of villages to their deaths all in the name of providing blood plasma to the wounded soldiers.",,0.0372147579693034,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-north-star_1943_36217.csv

Johnny and Polo have always looked out for each other, which is now made all the more difficult with Polo, unknown to Johnny, being attracted to Celia himself. Uneducated Polo is currently the largest household breadwinner working as a bouncer at a sleazy bar - it the best paying job with his skills - as Johnny, untold to Celia, has lost his latest job, the fourth such in the last three months. Without a word, Johnny often disappears for large periods of time, and although she inherently still loves him, Celia is uncertain if she can stay in a marriage in which he no longer touches her or acknowledges their baby, especially as she believes he is having an affair. She would admit to herself that in her loneliness she often does think about falling into Polo's arms. These issues are exacerbated by the visit of Johnny and Polo's father from Palm Beach, he who they have not seen since before Johnny and Celia's wedding, this thus the first time he will have met his daughter-in-law. Unknown to John Sr. who has always treated Johnny as the favored son, both Johnny and Polo have a strained relationship with him in he never being there when they need him. What John Sr. did not tell them before the arrival of his two day stay is that he has come specifically for $2,500 Polo had promised was his whenever he needed it, he wanting it for his retirement plans, with the problem being that Polo no longer has the money which further places Polo in John Sr.'s bad books. All of these issues stem directly from a secret Johnny is keeping, with Polo the only one in the family who knows: that Johnny is a two fix a day junkie, he having become addicted to morphine when he was in the hospital at the end of his military service. Polo's saved $2,500 went to Johnny for his fixes, while Johnny immediately owes ""Mother"", his primary supplier, $500 - money which Johnny doesn't have - Mother who knows the fine line of getting the money versus keeping Johnny hooked and thus keeping him as a lucrative customer.",,0.0151692963752665,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/a-hatful-of-rain_1957_50487.csv

Then George receives a tip to go to the Terminal Dock where he meets Anzelmo who explains that Larry Cravat is wanted by the police for the murder of a man at the dock to keep the money. Larry has disappeared and Anzelmo believes George Taylo is the man who was with him and probably the killer. George's further investigation finds that a man named Conroy was a witness to the crime, but he was hit and run by a truck and is interned at the Lambeth Sanatorium.

Zanuck,Lionel Newman,William C. Mellor,"In 1924 Chicago, Artie Strauss and Judd Steiner are friends and fellow law students who both come from wealthy backgrounds. They have few true friends as they believe all their contemporaries are intellectually inferior. Within their relationship, Artie is the dominant and Judd the submissive who says he will do whatever Artie tells him. Although Judd acts intellectually arrogant to others, he also shows signs of weakness and reticence most evident to Artie. Part of their goal in life is to experience how it feels to do everything. As such, they plot to commit what they consider the perfect crime - a kidnapping and murder - not only so that they can experience the sense of killing for killing's sake, but also taunt the law with the knowledge of it and their superiority after the fact. They believe their crime is above the law. Their murder of young Paulie Kessler is not so perfect, with evidence at the scene uncovered by one of their law school colleagues, Sid Brooks, who also works for the Globe newspaper. As Artie and Judd try to manipulate their way out of how the evidence may implicate them, their manipulation ultimately backfires and they are charged with the murder. The most famed trial lawyer in town, Jonathan Wilk, is hired to defend the pair despite his atheism being against the families' sensibilities. Jonathan, renowned for his ability to manipulate juries, has to decide how best to defend his clients in the overwhelming face of evidence against them. The testimony of Ruth Evans, Sid's girlfriend, may have some impact on the trial's outcome.",,0.0203898093841642,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/compulsion_1959_52700.csv

Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two ""collapsible"" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews, on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian, whom - if that steamship had responded, the loss of life could have been far, far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days, before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the ""women and children first,"" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject, it stands well the test-of-time for its ""just the facts"" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.",,0.016598957609451,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/a-night-to-remember_1958_51994.csv

After the funeral, neighbor Nathan Dillon claims that Chad's foster family owed him money. In order to recoup what's owed to him he tries to force Chad to become his indentured servant. When Chad refuses, Dillon and his son jump Chad and a fistfight ensues. Passerby neighbor Caleb Turner takes Chad's side and together they prevail. Caleb Turner offers Chad the chance to live with the Turners. Chad accepts to work on the Turner farm in order to pay for his keep. The arrangement is temporary because Chad intends to head for Lexington as soon as the logging season is over. Later, in Lexington, Chad meets Major Buford at an auction of thoroughbred horses. The Major, who is a childless, widowed landowner, likes Chad and adopts the young man. During the following months, Major Buford tries his best to turn Chad from a mountain man into a southern gentleman. However, at various social gatherings and society balls Chad senses that most rich families don't accept him as one of their own because of Chad's poor country background. Chad has a romance with Margaret Dean but her family rejects him due to his background. Eventually, Major Buford sends Chad to Lexington College. When the Civil War starts, Major Buford proudly presents Chad with the new uniform of a junior Confederate officer. However, Chad, facing a moral dilemma about slavery, tells a heart-broken Buford that he decided to join the Union Army. Crossing the Union lines, Chad seeks his old foster parent Caleb Turner who is a lieutenant in the Union Army. With Caleb's recommendation, Chad is accepted into the Union Army and becomes a mounted courier. He eventually reaches the rank of lieutenant. During an advance into Confederate territory, the Union Army reaches Lexington. There, Chad and Caleb Turner together with their men will finally face the Confederate defenders of Lexington. Among them are Major Buford and Margaret Dean's officer brother and father. These particular Confederates are almost like family to Chad.

Wanting to stay in the business, he eventually moved to London to try and restart. Working up through the ranks at Commonwealth Pictures, Reggie was ultimately made Executive Producer at the studio by the studio chief, Ben Case, who, upon Reggie's ascension, is now more the studio figurehead. And while some have labeled the move more one to assume power, Reggie also married Ben's daughter, Lesley, in he trying to put his past behind him in truly loving her. He is working on what is arguably the biggest picture of his career, Eclipse - one that Ben admittedly has little faith in in he seeing it as being overblown - and as such calls in a favor from an old friend, Hollywood actress Kay Wallace, a former lover who would admit that the prospect of starting up again with Reggie was as much a draw in coming to London as working on the picture itself. It was about the time that he started working on this picture that Reggie also started receiving letters from an Evelyn Stewart, an American in Newcastle. Despite his claims that he doesn't know her, the letters are love letters of sorts, pleading for him to let her back into his life. The more letters he receives, the more he believes that what she is writing she at least believes is the truth, she able to back up her claims of ""their past"" with dates and places, places he admits he was at at the times listed. Going to Newcastle to confront her leads to even more confusion on his part as the stronger her conviction, the more he becomes convinced that she is indeed telling the truth. Is Reggie going crazy like he thinks he is, or is there something else at play behind her assertions?",,0.025946644295302,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/finger-of-guilt_1956_49210.csv

That nightmare culminates when Catherine's unit is being shipped back to the United States, the only way that Henr√≠ can enter the United States as her spouse being under the War Brides Act. Henr√≠ ends up being classified among one hundred thirty-nine other war brides, one hundred twenty-six children of war brides, nine dogs, three cats, two canaries and one parrot, none having as much trouble that he has despite he being ""approved"" as ""Mrs. Henr√≠ Rochard"".",,0.0146318933333333,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/i-was-a-male-war-bride_1949_41498.csv

Frankie goes to reform school with dreams of leading a decent life, but those dreams are shattered when he is sentenced to the state penitentiary for slugging a trusty who was cruel to a fellow prisoner. His term completed, Frankie decides to go home to St. Mary, Ohio, and is accompanied by Jud Mason and Bert ""The Mouse"" Gatto, two friends from prison. Frankie finds that St. Mary has changed, however, and decides to move to Cleveland, where Carol has a struggling career as a singer. Carol convinces Frankie to settle down in Cleveland and get a job, but his plans go awry when, returning home one evening after a date with Carol, he learns that Jud and The Mouse have gone to rob a restaurant. Frankie rushes to stop them, but is too late, and arrives just as a man is killed. Frankie refuses to let Carol testify in his behalf and is convicted and sentenced to death. Meanwhile, Charley Smith, the only classmate of Frankie's who has become financially successful, invites his old schoolmates to return to St. Mary for a reunion. Under a cloud of gloom, the class reassembles and Carol and former classmate John Shelley beg Charley to help Frankie, but he smugly refuses. Hearing of the reunion, Frankie escapes from his cell and speeds home, bursting into the schoolroom just as Carol denounces Charley for his lack of compassion. After urging Carol to forgive Charley, Frankie bids farewell to his old schoolmates and leaves the building.

One evening at his local pub, he overhears a conversation between a man and a woman that he knows involves criminal activity, what he surmises to be the kidnapping plot of a child in exactly one week's time. The local police patronizingly dismiss his report as the overactive imagination of a blind writer. With Jean and his faithful manservant Bob Matthews by his side - the former with some reluctance on Phil's part - Phil goes on a search to uncover the plot using what little pieces of information he has at hand, which includes the man's name being Evans, the woman, who is involved under duress, working as a nanny for a family whose head is formally a lady, that lady having attended a concert that evening, the family living along a certain bus route, and the nanny herself wearing an expensive perfume well beyond her means. His physical disability is an obvious disadvantage.

Adam Reed is a self employed scout with friendly ties to the Cheyenne. Upset about the construction of the new fort on their lands, the Cheyenne ask scout Reed to contact Major Ives and deliver their message of grievance to him. The symbolic message consists of a yellow tomahawk as a warning against the building of a new fort in the area. Reed delivers the warning message to Major Ives but he is not taken serious. Major Ives lectures Reed about the need of bringing civilization to the lands that otherwise would go to waste under the savages. Reed retorts that Major Ives' only duty is to escort wagon trains of settlers passing through Cheyenne territory rather than build new forts in violation of the treaty. Reed also mentions the fact that Major Ives has a bad reputation with the Cheyenne who call him 'the Butcher' because of past massacres committed against Indians. Major Ives refuses to heed Reed's warnings, calls Reed a traitor and orders him to remain in the army camp to prevent him from returning to the Cheyenne. Reed obeys but warns everyone in the camp of a major Cheyenne attack. Major Ives orders the hurried construction of a reinforced defensive compound.

Although Thorndike had intended to carry out a ""sporting stalk"" only, and does not have bullets in his gun, he loads the weapon after locating the target. A German soldier surprises him, however, and his bullet goes astray. Thorndike is brought to Gestapo Major Quive-Smith, to whom he explains that he did not intend to kill Hitler. Quive-Smith does not believe him, however, and orders him to confess that his assassination attempt was at the request of the British government. Although Quive-Smith promises him freedom, Thorndike refuses to sign the prepared confession and is tortured by the Gestapo. When Thorndike still refuses to sign, Quive-Smith arranges for him to be thrown off a cliff in what will look like an accident, but he falls into a river and survives. The next day, the Gestapo searches for Thorndike but he eludes his pursuers and reaches a harbor, where he boards a boat bound for Britain. An intrepid cabin boy named Vaner hides him while one of Quive-Smith's men, Mr. Jones, boards with Thorndike's passport. Vaner keeps Thorndike hidden during the journey, but once he is ashore, Thorndike realizes that Jones and other Gestapo agents are following him, and he ducks into an apartment to escape. He appeals to the apartment's resident, a young Cockney woman named Jerry Stokes, for aid, and she helps him get to his brother's house. Thorndike's brother, Lord Gerald Risborough, is an ambassador, who warns him that the German embassy is looking for him, and that England must acquiesce if Germany demands his extradition. Thorndike vows to disappear from England, then leaves with Jerry and sleeps on her couch. The next morning, Thorndike outlines his plans and does not notice that Jerry has fallen in love with him. She pouts until he takes her to buy a pin to replace the one she lost from her tam-o'-shanter, and she chooses a large chromium arrow. Jerry then accompanies Thorndike to the office of his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy, where he tries to give her five hundred pounds. She refuses the money, and their squabbling is cut short when an assistant announces that Quive-Smith and Jones are on their way to the office. Thorndike and Jerry escape to the Underground, where Thorndike is chased by Jones. After a fight, Jones is electrocuted on the third rail, and, because he still carries Thorndike's passport, his corpse is identified as the hunter. Realizing that the British police are now after him as well, Thorndike instructs Jerry to write to him at Lyme Regis in three weeks with any news. After a tearful farewell, Jerry returns to her apartment, where Quive-Smith is waiting for her. Three weeks later, Thorndike, who has been living in a cave in the woods, goes to the post office to pick up Jerry's letter. When he returns to his cave, Thorndike discovers that the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him and blocked the cave's opening. Through a small opening, Quive-Smith hands Thorndike Jerry's tam-o'-shanter and says that she was found dead on the street after jumping out her window. Enraged by Jerry's murder, Thorndike finally admits that he did intend to kill Hitler, although he did not realize it at the time. Stalling for time, Thorndike agrees to sign the confession and constructs a bow while Quive-Smith opens the entrance to the cave. As Quive-Smith reaches for the signed confession, Thorndike shoots him with the arrow from Jerry's hat. As he dies, Quive-Smith shoots Thorndike with a pistol, but before he collapses, Thorndike destroys the confession. Months pass as Thorndike recuperates and Europe is thrown into war. Once he has recovered, Thorndike joins the RAF, and on a reconnaissance mission over Germany, bails out with a high-powered rifle, intent on fulfilling his purpose this time.",,0.0229364692218351,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/man-hunt_1941_33873.csv

However, her guardians, her aunt and uncle, aiming to get rich, insist that she marry Don Pedro, the town mayor, an arrogant and bullying much older man. She resigns herself to her fate but before the wedding, in nearby Port Sebastian, she meets by chance a troupe of traveling circus actors, led by the handsome Serafin. Attracted to each another but, while Serafin wants to woo Manuela, she refuses his advances claiming to be promised in marriage to Don Pedro. At the circus show, during a hypnosis act, Serafin learns that Manuela is secretly enamored of Macoco. This revelation persuades Serafin to resort to a trick to woo her. He pretends to be the famous pirate Macoco and he plays the part well, assisted by the complicity of his troupe. His performance is so well-executed that it convinces everyone, including Manuela, that he truly is Macoco the pirate. Unfortunately, it also convinces the local authorities and the visiting Spanish Viceroy that he is a wanted pirate. Serafin, masquerading as Macoco, is arrested by the Spanish troops. Despite his pleas that he only is a circus actor impersonating a pirate, he is found guilty of piracy, partly on fake evidence supplied by a fearful and jealous Don Pedro. Serafin, aka Macoco the pirate, is sentenced to death by hanging.

The appointment is despite the reservations of the Reverend Mother who believes Sister Clodagh not ready for such an assignment, especially because of its isolated location. The convent will be a new one located in the mountainside Palace of Mopu in the Himalayas, and is only possible through the donation by General Todo Rai of Mopu - ""The Old General"" - of the palace, where the Old General's father formerly kept his concubine. On the Old General's directive, the convent is to provide schooling to the children and young women, and general dispensary services to all native residents who live in the valley below the palace. Accompanying Sister Clodagh will be four of the other nuns, each chosen for a specific reason: Sister Briony for her strength, Sister Phillipa who is to tend to the garden for food, Sister Blanche - more commonly referred to as Sister Honey - for her general ability to spread happiness, and troubled Sister Ruth, who the Reverend Mother believes will truly find her faith from the change in locale. The palace comes with an elderly female caretaker, slightly off kilter Angu Ayah, and a holy man who meditates in solitude and silence outside the palace grounds night and day, he who is not to be disturbed. The General also provides a young boy, six year old Joseph Anthony, the General's cook's son, who will live at the convent to provide translation services. But the sisters' primary liaison to the General and the outside world is his agent, native Brit Mr. Dean, which may prove to be problematic in his gender and doing any work around the convent. Sister Clodagh faces early challenges in feeling the need to accept two people to the convent: seventeen year old Kanchi, who is pushing the boundaries of her sexuality; and the Old General's son, the ""Young General"", who wants the same educational opportunities, if not better, than that offered to his female counterparts. Beyond these issues, each of the sisters is challenged by this posting, from the cultural differences, to the isolation, to the general openness of their environment. Sister Clodagh, as the leader, feels that she has no one to turn to in her confusion, her thoughts turning back to her time in Ireland before joining the order and her love for a young man named Con that was partly the reason for her decision to devote her life to God. But it is Sister Ruth whose issues may be the most problematic as she is becoming unhinged in her growing romantic obsession with Mr. Dean, especially as jealousy emerges in she also believing that Sister Clodagh is falling in love with him as well, which may or may not be the case.",,0.0426113557358053,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/black-narcissus_1947_39192.csv

Their task is to slow down the Japanese advance into eastern China by blowing up bridges, roads, airfields and munitions dumps. They start by blowing up an American airfield and ammo dump. They receive the order to destroy a vital bridge over a mountain pass. The team uses a few army trucks to move around. At the bridge, they encounter a Nationalist Chinese Army unit in charge of guarding the bridge. Thanks to an American soldier who speaks some Chinese, Major Baldwin requests the permission, from the Chinese commander, to blow up the bridge. The Chinese colonel agrees but asks the American Major to do him a favor by also destroying a munitions dump located at some distance away. He also requests that Madame Sue-Mei Hung, the widow of a Chinese colonel, be transported by the American demolition team to the nearest major town. Major Baldwin is reluctant to be responsible for the woman's life but he reluctantly agrees to transport her, in the name of Chinese-American war cooperation. Since the ammo dump is on the way, Major Baldwin also agrees to destroy it, at the request of the Chinese commanders. The Chinese dispatch Colonel Kwan to serve as liaison officer and translator with the American demolition team. Colonel Kwan also carries stamped orders from the Chinese commanders for any Chinese forces they might encounter on the way. Thus assembled, the demolition team of Major Baldwin commences its dangerous journey toward its objectives. With the Japanese forces advancing at a rapid pace, the team doesn't have much time at its disposal to achieve its goals. To make matters worse, the demolition team discovers that local Chinese folk, Chinese refugees and Chinese bandits roaming the region can be as much of a threat as the invading Japanese forces.",,0.037015484804631,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-mountain-road_1960_54095.csv

They nickname him Cooncat. They all suspect Cooncat of running from the law for some crime he committed but he claims to have only run-away from an abusive father who beat him. Nevertheless, the ranch hired hands rough him up until he admits he has committed a murder. Cooncat reveals he killed Jim Shell, the owner of a trading post because the man stole Cooncat's money. He claims that two drifters hiding in the nearby ruins of a house egged him on and even gave him a revolver to commit the murder. However, his recollection is hazy since he was hit over the head by the trading post owner right when he was about to shoot him. No one at the Davis ranch believes his story, except Meagan Davis, the daughter of the Davis patriarch. Cooncat offers to take the men to the trading post to see the body of the murdered owner. When they all go there, no body is found inside the abandoned trading post. The place looks like it has been abandoned for months. Cooncat is asked to describe the two drifters who pushed him to murder. After the boy describes the drifters, whom he calls Smiling Man and Roper, his hosts are shocked. The description fits that of two Jessup family members who were killed 15 years before, during a range and fence war with the Davis clan. Cooncat's captors wonder whether the boy is lying or is crazy. Rancher Pat Farrell, engaged to Abby Davis, Meagan's sister, wants to deliver the boy to the sheriff but the Davis family offers to lodge him at their ranch until his story can be checked out in more detail. During the following days, Cooncat escapes his hosts several times but he is re-captured. He claims that all their lives are in danger because he keeps sighting the two drifters, Smiling Man and Roper, snooping around the Davis' ranch. No one believes his strange claims, except for Meagan, of course, who took a liking to him. Next, rancher Pat Farrell' parents are found murdered and circumstances point to Cooncat. Farrell wants to lynch Cooncat but old man Davis saves him, arguing that more evidence is needed. A temporary rift between Farrell and Davis is thus born. Later, when Boatwhistle, the ramrod of the Davis ranch and direct custodian of Cooncat, is found shot to death, they all assume Cooncat to be responsible. Cooncat is missing and so is the revolver that was kept in the old man Davis' office desk drawer. Old man Davis suspects that a bent-on-revenge Cooncat actually is the youngest son of the rival Jessup clan, eliminated 15 years before. A manhunt for Cooncat ensues, but he secretly returns to the ranch to convince Meagan of his innocence. His aim is to find Smiling Man and Roper who are the real killers. With the Davis and the Farrell crews after him, Cooncat races against time to find the real killers before he is caught and lynched.",,0.0203109026963658,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/high-lonesome_1950_42552.csv

Goodkind","George H. Plympton, Basil Dickey, Mildred Barish, , Wyllis Cooper",Henry MacRae,Charles Previn,"Jerome Ash, William A. Sickner","""The Phantom Creeps"" was Universal's 44th sound-era serial (between ""The Oregon Trail"" and ""The Green Hornet"") and was re-issued to theaters in 1949 by Commonwealth Pictures Corporation, a distribution set-up handling primarily Universal re-issues. Commonwealth had no hand at all in the production of this serial (as incorrectly shown on site) as they were a distribution company only. Some sources mistakenly identify them as the serial producer because all of the 1949 re-issue prints (and the 16mm prints sold to television circa 1952) show ""Commonwealth Pictures Corp. Presents"" above the title.There is a whole lot of difference between ""presenting"" and ""producing"", a fact that some sources appear to not know or don't care. The serial is of interest to some collectors as it re-unites Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan from 1931's ""Dracula"", and the crater-discovery of the meteorite fragment by Zorka in the serial is stock footage from Universal's 1936 ""The Invisible Ray."" The stock footage of an explosion and avalanche used in Chapter 11 comes from Universal's 1934 serial, ""The Vanishing Shadow."" Plot finds eccentric scientist Dr. Alex Zorka carrying on various experiments in his secret laboratory with the aid of his assistant Monk. Zorka has invented many strange weapons of warfare, including a devisualizer belt which renders him invisible; a terrifying, eight-foot tall robot (played by stuntman Edwin ""Bud"" Wolfe and not circus giant Bud Wolff), and he also has a deadly meteorite fragment (which he found in a 1936 movie with Boris Karloff) from which he extracts an element which can induce suspended animation in an entire army. Foreign spies, operating under the guise of a foreign language school (great cover), are trying to buy or (mostly) steal the meteorite element, while his former partner, Dr. Fred Mallory, miffed that Zorka will not turn his inventions over to the U.S. Government, blows the whistle on him to Captain Bob West of the Military Intelligence Department. Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies and the government, Zorka moves his lab and when his beloved wife is killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this point, gets hacked off as only Lugosi can, swears eternal vengeance against society, and decides to use his inventions to make himself world dictator. And would have if not for his assistant Monk, an escaped convict virtually enslaved by Zorka, who is cowardly, treacherous and totally incompetent, and whose accidental or deliberate interference with Zorka's efforts repeatedly frustrates his master's grand schemes.",,0.0191430379746835,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-phantom-creeps_1939_31796.csv

The two chiefs travel on foot because their tribe has very few horses. They intend to meet the local army commander to complain that, with winter approaching, their tribe needs warm clothing, horses and food. The Cheyenne have no firearms, as per treaty stipulations, and they cannot hunt for food. The local army commander is Captain George, a cowardly heavy-drinking U.S. Cavalry officer. He greets the two Cheyenne chiefs by saying that his main concern is not the Cheyenne's needs but the needs of his own people. He also insists that he was given orders to remove the Cheyenne from the Black Hills to a reservation in Oklahoma. Chief Yellow Wolf replies that the Black Hills region is their native home and refuses to accept the re-settlement to a reservation in Oklahoma. He is willing to offer Captain George a trade. The chief will show Captain George an area of recently discovered gold deposits in return for assurances that his tribe will not be removed from the Black Hills. Captain George reluctantly agrees to the trade, but after the two Cheyenne chiefs leave, he sends his man Garvin to shoot at Yellow Wolf in the street, in order to intimidate the chief. Unfortunatelly, Garvin shoots the chief dead. The chief's son Little Wolf runs back to his tribe and vows vengeance on the town. Town marshal Tate secretly loves Yellow Wolf's daughter Pretty Willow who is Little Wolf's sister. Tate believes that the Cheyenne should be allowed to remain on their lands. He cautions the townsfolk that Little Wolf's warriors might raid the town to avenge their chief's death. However, Captain George and the rest of the townspeople dismiss this warning and make fun of Tate. They also demand Tate's resignation as town marshal. A disgusted Tate complies and hands-in his badge. He makes plans to move out of town soon. That very night, Little Wolf's warriors raid the town, steal army guns and horses, kill a few people and disappear. Having stolen most of the town's horses and weapons, the Cheyenne plan to return in force and massacre everyone. Ex-marshal Tate must race against time and find a way to save the town.",,0.0229951025056948,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/ride-out-for-revenge_1957_50900.csv

A young architect, Richard Ferraby, arrives from London to inspect the ancient home in regards to renovations, and he and Isla are immediately attracted to each other. Lady Lebanon tells her son that he must marry Isla to carry on the family name but Lord Willie tells her he has no intentions of marrying. Later, the family physician, Dr. Amersham, arrives and it is evident he has some unrevealed hold over Lady Lebanon. The chauffeur, Studd, hints that he knew Amersham in India and that Amersham was discharged from the Indian Army under unsavory circumstances. Isla and Richard find the chauffeur murdered and the suspicion falls on the gamekeeper, Tilling, whose wife had been more than a little friendly with Studd. But Chief Inspector Tanner and Deputy Sergeant Totty arrive from Scotland Yard and uncover evidence that points to Dr. Aversham as the killer, and Lord Willie substantiates the clue by telling them that Aversham had strangled a young Eurasian girl in India by using a red scarf and Studd, also, had been found strangled with a red scarf.

Once the train departs, the one person who it is uncertain is on the train is a middle aged English governess named Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty). Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), who was vacationing in Mandrika with girlfriends before heading back to England to get married, is certain that Miss Froy was on the train as they were in the same compartment and they had tea together in the dining car, but all those people who can corroborate her story don't seem to want to do so.

Martin, who knows that Cory has copped a plea with the D.A. to save himself, arranges a meeting. At the meeting, Cory's henchman, Cute Freddie, shoots Martin and the latter kills Freddie. Cory hides in the Greenwich Village apartment of his girl friend, burlesque queen Lily White. With them is Lily's six-year-old daughter, Elsie, and her dog Skipper. Martin trails Cory, but weakened by his bullet wound, is forced to seek refuge in an abandoned building next to Lily's. Bad-to-the-bone Cory kicks Skipper and the dog finds shelter with Martin, where Elsie finds them sleeping. Martin is charmed by Elsie and the dog, whom he names Johnny One-Eye, and takes the animal to a vet who can't help the dog but does take the bullet slug out of Martin. Barely eluding capture, Martin returns to the building where Elsie tells him she is Lily's daughter, and that Cory is hiding in their house. Later Cory follows Elsie to where Martin is hiding. She is caught in the line of fire and, to save her, Martin exposes himself for a fatal wound from Cory but not before he kills Cory.

The Tophams have lived in Dunmow for fifteen years, but are still seen as outsiders by the Dunmow traditionalists, especially Miss Rosabelle Honeycroft, the elder domineering sister of the mild-mannered vicar, Hayworth Honeycroft. That is why Miss Honeycroft is so irked that Marjorie Topham has nominated her son, Basil Topham, and Basil's wife, Julie Topham, as the only entrants in this year's Flitch. Basil and Julie's young married life is not perfect as they live with Basil's parents, Marjorie and Aubrey Topham, and Basil's grandfather, Hillary Topham - which is a little too cozy for Julie's tastes - while their house is being built by local contractor Stanley Grimes, who seems in no hurry to get the job done. Basil and Julie didn't want to enter the Flitch as it places their life under a microscope. The lives of the Tophams and of all the men in town are turned upside down with the arrival of the Topham's new housekeeper, the exotically beautiful Marta, a Hungarian who had ulterior motives for wanting the job and who has expensive and refined tastes. Basil and Aubrey are both as captivated by Marta as any man in town, which doesn't sit well with Julie. Miss Honeycroft's attempts to disqualify Basil and Julie from the Flitch for any reason, Marta kissing Basil and whether anyone saw, and the missing flitch (which was pilfered but many who feel directly responsible for what they believe is them losing it) add to the confusion as the trial proceeds.",,0.026388246628131,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/made-in-heaven_1952_44864.csv

Jane's visit coincides with it being ""the season"" in London: when all the society debutantes hold their balls to ""come out"" as being ready to find a suitable mate and marry. Sheila, as her first act of being Jane's British stepmother, wants Jane to come out along with all her British peers. Sheila believes that someone like if not David Fenner (Peter Myers) himself, he a guard at Buckingham Palace, would be a suitable mate for Jane. In attending some of the earlier season balls, Jane not only finds David Fenner a drip, but she also does not want to step on the toes of her first true friend in London, Clarissa Claremont (Diane Clare), who is in love with Fenner. Fenner, in turn, doesn't seem to know that Clarissa as a potential mate even exists while he sets his sights on Jane. That doesn't stop Clarissa's scheming mother, Mabel Claremont (Dame Angela Lansbury), from preventing anything from happening between Fenner and Jane so that Clarissa can end up with Fenner. Instead, Jane seems to be falling for twenty-three-year-old David Parkson (John Saxon), an Italian-American working as a drummer, his band playing at many of the social events among this circle. It isn't so much that he is a drummer, but Sheila buys into the rumors of David Parkson having been untoward to fellow deb Brenda Bassington in viewing him as unsuitable courting material for Jane. While he does what he needs to to appease his wife, Jimmy can see beyond the rumors eventually to get to the truth, specifically when he learns that Jane and Parkson, who he truly likes, are indeed in love. Jimmy has to find a way to make Sheila see the truth about Parkson, just telling her which he knows will not do the trick.",,0.0147987795575896,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-reluctant-debutante_1958_52126.csv

Unknown to him is the fact that shipping docks owner Zero Saxon is a crooked businessman and a racketeer. Using a complex scheme, Saxon is stealing legitimate cargo and switches this cargo for phony cargo. This scheme involves his network of trucks, rail cars and ships. Most longshoremen make extra money by turning a blind eye to the racket and they're also afraid of Saxon's hired killers. Dan Corbett meets nice gal Alma Mae who invites him at the longshoremen picnic where he's introduced to Jack Petty, business agent for the longshoremen's union, and Joe Reilly, Saxon's dock manager. Dan Corbett befriends Joe Reilly, his wife Marie and her brother Scrappy Durant. Joe Reilly is a nice guy and offers Dan Corbett a job on the docks. Unfortunately, Joe is on the take and implicated in Saxon's racket. When he tries to quit the racket and go into a legitimate business, Joe is killed by Saxon's henchmen Deuce and Big Mike. That's when Dan Corbett starts suspecting that Saxon is heading a criminal enterprise. He summons the president of the Longshoremen Association and the Chief of Police to a secret meeting. At the meeting, a plan to expose Saxon's racket and to trap him is agreed upon. However, this plan involves the planting of a radio transmitter into Saxon's cargo crates and Dan Corbett is the only man available for this job.

As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city. Tony's actions place an unspoken strain between Tony and Johnny to the point of the two knowing that they can't exist in their idealized world with the other. Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence.

Fred narrates the film in flashback, detailing a suburban bank robbery that goes awry. In his simple plan, he hires a hard-up hood, Johnny Cabot to take the wife of the bank's vice president hostage. Cabot will hold her until he gets a call alerting him that Fred has been successful in getting ransom money. Cabot waits, and watches the Wilson house as the husband leaves for the bank and their young son heads off to school. Posing as a door-to-door guitar instructor, he forces his way into the house and takes Nancy Wilson hostage. At the bank, Fred talks his way into Ken Wilson's office, and presents his personal check for $70,000, intending that Wilson will withdraw the funds to cover the check as a ransom for his wife. He has Wilson call home to prove that Nancy is being held by the unstable Cabot, and gives Wilson 5 minutes to make his decision. If Fred fails to call the house back, Cabot is to kill Nancy. Wilson confesses to Fred that he has been planning to run off to Las Vegas with Ellen, the woman he has been having an affair with, and Fred will be doing him a favor by getting rid of Nancy. But as the minutes tick by, Wilson cracks and agrees to give him the money. Fred make the first call to save Nancy. The clock starts ticking again, another 5 minutes, for Fred to collect the money and get out of the bank safely. While Fred is working on Wilson, Nancy is terrorized by Cabot-- manhandled and shot at, invited to slip into something more comfortable (which she does in a futile attempt to distract him) and finally forced to listen to him serenade her with ""Five Minutes to Live"" and ""I've Come to Kill"" while he waits for the second call. The call hasn't come as Fred has been overpowered by the police, who were alerted by the bank's silent alarm. Cabot is getting more and more stressed. While worrying about Fred not calling, he is completely thrown by Little Bobby arriving home for lunch just as the police arrive at the Wilson house. Cabot panics, grabs Bobby and runs into the yard under police fire. Bobby fakes his death to save himself, and Cabot is shot by a cop in the yard. Nancy is reunited with her now-contrite husband, who decides he will still go to Las Vegas, but with Nancy.",,0.0368865784499055,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/five-minutes-to-live_1961_54817.csv

Biff has just once again moved his dental practice into yet another neighborhood, the fact and news of he being an ex-con which seems to follow him from place to place, quickly drying up his patient pool. He blames his incarceration on Hugo. Years ago, Biff was in love with beautiful but self-absorbed Virginia Brush, who he was planning on asking to marry him, but she ended up marrying Hugo who knew that Biff was interested in her. On the rebound, Biff started dating and ended up marrying Virginia's free-thinking, emancipated friend, nurse Amy Lind, who was the fourth wheel in double dates with Biff, Hugo and Virginia. On a beautiful Sunday afternoon in June just as Biff and Amy are about to go out for a walk, as do many couples on spring Sunday afternoons, Biff receives a call to perform an emergency tooth extraction, the patient who he learns is Hugo. Hugo, in turn, probably did not know the dentist is Biff when the call was made. The fact of Hugo reentering his life makes Biff not only contemplate what he will do when he meets Hugo again, but reflect on his life, the often unrecognized important aspects which may come to the forefront in this reflection.",,0.0239431589537223,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/one-sunday-afternoon_1948_40668.csv

Lisbon's police inspector, Joao Casimiro Fonseca, is aware of this and often times tries to catch Evans red-handed but to no avail. At the same time, American Sylvia Merrill, wife of industrialist Lloyd Merrill, arrives in Lisbon to arrange the secret release from a Communist prison from behind the Iron Curtain of her husband. She first complains to the State Department about her husband's imprisonment but U.S. officials seem unable to make any progress to obtain his release. Sylvia Merrill contacts big shot criminal, jewel thief and smuggler Aristides Mavros, a Greek living in Lisbon, to negotiate a bribe for Communist officials and have her hubby released from their prisons. Mavros is a man with many useful connections but he's also a scoundrel not to be trusted by anyone. He figures to woo the wealthy Sylvia Merrill and convince her to agree to have her husband murdered after his rescue from Communist custody. This way, Sylvia Merrill, who is very much younger than her elderly husband, can inherit all his money and reward Mavros with one million dollars for his assistance. Mavros hires the services of Captain Evans to use his boat for the Lloyd Merrill rescue mission. Mavros also tasks his henchman Serafim to kill Merill after his rescue and make it look like an accident. He also tells Serafim to kill Captain Evans on the return trip, in order to eliminate all witnesses. However, Mavros fails to take into account the perseverance of police inspector Fonseca or the love for Captain Evans of one of Mavros' young secretaries, local beauty Maria Maddalena Masanet.",,0.0199240298507463,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/lisbon_1956_49446.csv

He told Millie that he was on alert solely in wanting to break up with her in discovering she was not the brightest light in the world. And while he seems to like Helen Palmer more, he has told her the same, he dating her which is only complicated by she being the girlfriend Pvt. Jack Edwards, who wants to make Vic's life miserable when he discovers that Millie is again trying to enter his life.

Coffee, , Margaret Echard",Henry Blanke,Max Steiner,Sidney Hickox,"Actress Shelley Carnes (Ruth Roman), is looking forward to an exciting vacation at a dude ranch, but she gets more than she bargained for, including a perhaps murderous new husband. Only by sheer luck has Richard Trevelyan (Richard Todd), her new husband, escaped execution for murdering his first wife Loraine. In a second trial, a single juror held out, causing him to be released. A local priest, Father Paul (Rhys Williams), and other eyewitnesses paint a deadly picture to the future bride but the actual murder was not witnessed and somehow, unbelievably, love wins out. Because of local expectation, Shelley ends up at a competing dude ranch run by J.D. (Frank Conroy) and Myra Nolan (Kathryn Givney). The picture of Richard over their fireplace suggests a close relationship. They loan Shelley their car and direct her to go to Trevelyan's ranch. En route, she meets Trevelyan on horseback, a handsome, but damaged, and mysterious young man. Upon arrival at the ranch she finds out the dude ranch is closed. She learns this from two rather worrisome characters, the local caretakers, Liza McStringer (Mercedes McCambridge) a rather seedy country girl, who runs it with her younger brother nicknamed String (Darryl Hickman). Shelley pretends to be a friend of the late wife and stays the night, perhaps in an attempt to gather more information about the mysterious ranch owner, in what is probably not a safe move. The following day she seeks out Richard and finds him moody, sitting at the edge of a great cliff. He saves her from falling. One thing leads to another as a friend of the Nolans, Harvey Turner (Zachary Scott) pretends first to kidnap Shelley for romantic reasons, and then he turns out to be a friend of Richard's, taking her to Richard at his guest house. After a quick marriage, their marriage night turns wicked as the new, but moody, husband claims to have attacked a large spider in their wedding bed, but he has a murderous look in his eye. She runs back to the closed dude ranch there to be confronted by jealous and spiteful Liza who turns out to be the real murderer. Shelley is able to fight off Liza just as Richard arrives to save her. Has he suspected or known all along? But as Lisa and her brother attempt to escape in a high speed chase with police, things end abruptly in a fatal crash.

The cult's aim being the extermination of the White man in Africa. Matt also meets the missionary's pretty niece, anthropologist Ann Wilson and big game hunter Gil Rossi, a Frenchman who was George's business partner. Rossi implies that he, George and a man named Elliott Hastings jointly owned a mine in the bush country beyond Mombasa. Apparently, the mine contained something more precious than gold. However, missionary Ralph Hoyt tells Matt that the mine is most likely worthless and tries to dissuade Matt from seeking the mine. Nevertheless, a funeral for George is planned and they all prepare to travel in the bush country to where Elliott Hastings and George were when George was killed by the mysterious Leopard Men. Matt Campbell is anxious to retrieve his brother's body for burial and also to find out who killed George and why. Given the fact that, at the moment, Kenya is going through the Mau Mau rebellious uprising of the Kikuyu tribes, Matt is not sure of who killed George.

Although he confessed to the murder in order to obtain penicillin for his illness, Simon is innocent. During the final days of the war, Simon and three other men tried to steal penicillin, from a British Army outpost, for sale on the black market. During the robbery, a British guard got killed. Simon was captured and he initially refused to incriminate himself. However, Simon's accomplices told him that his girlfriend, Anna DeBurg (Mai Zetterling), died. With nothing to lose, Simon agreed to falsely confess to the murder of the British soldier in order to save the others, and also to receive antibiotics for his illness. The military authorities convict him and sentence him to life in prison. During his transport by train to a central prison, Simon tries to escape. His escape fails and he ends up in the prison hospital where he recovers from his illness. While convalescing, a bewildered Simon is shocked to receive a visit from his girlfriend Anna, who is alive. Simon realizes that his accomplices lied to him about Anna in order to send him into despair and to confess to the British soldier's murder. Simon suspects that one of his partners, Paul Ravitch (Albert Lieven), is the man who set him up. Simon and Anna are desperate to get Simon a new trial. But no one believes him to be innocent, since he confessed to the murder. Simon's only chance is to escape from the prison hospital and track down his three former accomplices in order to obtain their truthful testimony regarding Simon's innocence. However, tracking his partners through post-war Germany and finding the real killer, with both British and German Police on his tail, would be no easy task for him and Anna.

The police are called by planetarium director Dr. A. M. Trowbridge, and Lieutenant Ted Mallory and Detective Regan quickly arrive. Everyone present at the lecture takes their seats as Mallory questions them and learns that all were invited guests, except for Hayden Amal, a Hindu. When Clay Gorman, Dr. Stone's secretary, claims Stone and Amal had quarreled, Amal is arrested and the others are released. After Mallory questions Kay Palmer, an attractive newspaper reporter, about her age and marital status, he returns to the station and tells his boss ""Chief,"" the district attorney, that Amal is only being held for illegal entry into the country and is not suspected of the murder. As Mallory investigates the backgrounds of possible suspects, he learns that Langsdale, Dr. Trowbridge's assistant, is an ex-convict, formerly known as Fremont, who tried to kill a scientist named Griffith for stealing one of his formulas. Another aid, Morgan, sold Amal his invitation to the lecture, and Einfeld claims to have never met Stone. Kay concocts a story for her newspaper indicating that Einfeld has suspicions as to the identity of the murderer, and Dr. Trowbridge calls Einfeld's hotel at the same time as Einfeld receives a threat on his life. Upon returning to the observatory that evening, Einfeld is heavily guarded, and a gun that had been stolen from him earlier is found on the floor near the giant telescope. Gorman is caught speeding on his way out of town, and Jim Gray, the observatory watchman, goes to the district attorney with evidence that Einfeld did in fact know Stone. Everyone present at the scene of Stone's murder is reassembled at the observatory, and after a shot is heard, Einfeld is found crumpled on the floor near the gun. Mallory excuses everyone from the room except Kay, and Einfeld stands up, alive. A firing mechanism that is activated by the star Arcturus is discovered attached to the telescope, and appears to have been inspired by an exposition at the Chicago World's Fair. After the telescope and firing mechanism are re-set, the suspects are gathered together once more, with Einfeld still playing dead as Mallory reports that Einfeld committed suicide after killing Stone. Mallory then reviews his reasons for suspecting Gorman, Morgan and Langsdale, who was under investigation because Mallory discovered that Stone had once gone by the name Griffith, the scientist whom Langsdale had attempted to murder. Jim's evidence, however, was clearly faked, and Mallory declares that he shot Stone for letting his son die in an operation. Jim is killed when his own device in the telescope fires again. As the guests file out, Einfeld gives a private astronomy lecture to Mallory and Kay, and then leaves them in the darkness of the planetarium.",,0.02188391959799,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/death-from-a-distance_1935_27504.csv

On one side, the industry workers want to organize themselves into labor unions that will fight for them in obtaining better wages, better working conditions and other benefits. On the other side, the factory owners and their managers staunchly oppose unionization. At one of the largest garment companies, Roxton Fashions, the owner, Walter Mitchell, is fighting against his workers' wishes to unionize. For the past 15 years, Walter Mitchell has been using the mob muscle in order to protect his company against unions. His gangster friend Artie Ravidge, and his henchmen, provide Walter Mitchell and Roxton Fashions with such protection against union men who agitate the workers into forming their own union locals. This protection includes murder, whenever necessary, to eliminate stubborn union men. Unfortunately, when Walter Mitchell's business partner, Fred Kenner, argues in favor of allowing a union into their factory, he meets with a suspicious fatal accident. The freight elevator in which he was traveling plummets to the ground, after being serviced by a suspicious repair-man. After the funeral, Walter Mitchell's son, Alan Mitchell, who recently returns from the Korean War, starts asking questions about the rumors concerning Fred Kenner's assassination and about the role of the mob in his father's company. His father denies the rumors but his son becomes more suspicious. When a garment industry union organizer, Tulio Renata, comes into the factory and creates a scene, arguing with the factory owner and promising the forming of a union local for the workers, the owner's son starts making inquiries on his own, against his father's wishes. He befriends union man Tulio Renata in order to learn more about the just and fair aims of the union directed at the garment industry. First viewed with mistrust, the factory owner's son, gradually gains the respect and the trust of Renata, of the union men and the workers themselves. But this union-friendly attitude of Alan Mitchell draws the ire of his father who, once more, uses his gangster friend Artie Ravidge's services to eliminate his foes. Only, this time, his own son is on the side of the unions.",,0.0283356330014225,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-garment-jungle_1957_50424.csv

After they return to his apartment, have a fight, and she leaves, the mystery woman slips in and begs for his help. Police Inspector Bacon and the cops show up, looking for the mystery woman; Murdock hides her. Murdock goes with the cops to discuss the murder the woman is suspected of. Bacon explains (in flashback) how some photographers were setting up a shot with Girard and Redfield. When the flashbulbs popped, Redfield keeled over dead and the woman, Meg Archer, fled while the newsmen ran out to phone their papers. The newsmen (who were rounded up later as thoroughly as possible) are taken into police custody, except for Murdock (who wasn't at the scene), who is given a cap on the sly by rival McGoogin. Although evidence suggests Meg is guilty, Murdock returns to his apartment and pledges to help her. She drugs his drink, but in the middle of the night, someone breaks in, knocks her out, and ransacks Murdock's photography equipment. They awaken in the morning and Murdock finds a photo plate in the cap McGoogin gave him. It's a picture taken by one of the photographers from behind Redfield and probably shows the killer preparing to murder him. Girard arrives and tries to bribe Murdock. The cops arrive, with McGoogin, and McGoogin pockets the photo plate. Girard threatens Murdock and Meg, implying that he staged Meg's father's suicide; they have to get the photo plate back and try to clear Meg's name - and get out of his engagement to Hester. The story becomes more and more convoluted, with the shooting of McGoogin and then Meg, the arrival of the brother of the man Girard was on trial for killing, and Murdock's decision to confront Girard on his own terms.",,0.0342339782345828,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/murder-with-pictures_1936_28004.csv

Cottrell plunders the region for personal gain rather than in the name of the Union, as he claims. Driven from their land, many settlers move to Texas, still a neutral territory. Kip, Charlie and Lee go to Brownsville, Texas, looking for Cottrell. After a fistfight between Kip and Cottrell, Cottrell is told to leave Texas. While Lee decides to join the Confederate army, Kip and Charlie try to raise money to rebuild their ranch. Eventually, they get involved in smuggling arms for the Confederacy, bypassing the blockade imposed by the Union. This lucrative enterprise brings them into conflict with Cottrell who, after leaving the Union cause, is also smuggling guns out of Mexico. After a series of conflicts, crosses and double-crosses between Cottrell and the three friends, the Confederates capture Brownsville. Kip suggests they all return to rebuild their cattle ranch. However, Lee chooses to remain in the Confederate army and continue the fight. Charlie, who's more interested in money and gunrunning than in ranching, decides to continue the smuggling. Kip and Charlie continue the smuggling together. After they high-jack a gun shipment belonging to Cottrell, the two partners find themselves in open conflict with Cottrell's outfit. During an ambush set-up by Cottrell, a gunfight ensues but the two friends prevail. Cottrell is killed by his former henchman, Slim. After the Civil War, Kip moves to Mexico. Charlie opens a saloon in Brownsville where he hires some of Cottrell's ex-henchmen, including Slim. Lee is disbanded from the army and joins the Texas Rangers in Brownsville. This puts him at odds with Charlie who's involved in a variety of shady businesses. Lee is the only lawman in Brownsville whereas Charlie has Cottrell's former outfit behind him. Word gets to Kip in Mexico about an imminent shootout between Lee and Charlie.

John Madison Hoskins returns home for a short leave after spending two years at sea. In 1942, he is given command of the USS Hornet (CV-8). Unfortunately, news reach him that the Hornet has recently been sunk by the Japanese. Without a ship, Hoskins is temporarily reassigned as an instructor at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. In 1944, Hoskins is finally sent to the front lines. He's given command of the USS Princeton (CVL-23) involved in the on-going Philippine campaign. When Hoskins arrives to replace the current Captain of the Princeton, as part of the routine rotation of skippers practiced by the Navy, he is told to assist the Princeton's Captain rather than take over command of the ship. The reason being that the Princeton's skipper, Capt. William Buracker, is already briefed on the on-going operation and it would take too much time for the Navy to bring Hoskins up to speed. However, Hoskins agrees to serve on the ship as prospective commanding officer under Buracker's command. During the battle operations, the Princeton is crippled by a Japanese dive-bomber. The resulting fire sets-off explosions in the fuel and ammunition stores. Capt. Hoskins assists the crew in battling the raging fires but a huge explosion wounds him and severs his right foot. The Princeton is abandoned and sinks. Hoskins recovers at a naval hospital in Philadelphia where the new Princeton is being build. He is determined to learn to walk with a prosthetic foot and stay-on in active duty. During the following months, Capt. Hoskins fights the Navy panel convened to retire him off. He persuades the panel to allow him to remain in active duty but faces the prospect of being assigned to a permanent desk job. Nevertheless, Hoskins remains in the service and is totally surprised to learn that he is given command of the newly built USS Princeton (CV-37). Out of love and admiration, many servicemen and friends call him 'Uncle John' or 'Peg-Leg'. After the war, Hoskins is promoted to Rear-Admiral and transferred to San Diego where he advocates the use of the new jet-fighters on aircraft-carriers. Despite the Navy's reluctance, Hoskins demonstrates to the Navy brass that jets can safely be used on the decks of the carriers. As a result, the Navy gives him command of the carrier division for aircraft operation at sea and he joins Admiral Struble's 7th Fleet. When the Korean War breaks-out, Hoskins' idea of using jets on aircraft-carriers proves to be valuable and efficient. In 1951, he's given the choice of two other important assignments but he declines. Looking forward to retirement, Hoskins requests and is assigned to the Military Air Transport Service where he coordinates logistics by air transport for all branches of service.",,0.0201741604477612,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-eternal-sea_1955_48047.csv

DuPar,"During the second-half of 1944, various Allied units stationed in Belgium attempt to smash their way through the tough German defenses at the Siegfried Line. If successful, the way to Germany is wide-open. One of these units is the American 3rd Armored Division. The film's story concerns a particular five-tank platoon, commanded by Lt. Rawson, the best platoon in Captain Bob Horner's Company C. During an ambush, the lead tank, California Jane, commanded by Master Sgt. Joe Davis, is seriously damaged by a German Panther tank. Davis is severely wounded and his driver is killed. Soon after, a replacement sergeant takes over Davis' role. However, the new man, staff sergeant Francis Aloysius Sullivan is cocky, heartless and tactless. His behavior frustrates both his men and his superiors. Many suspect that Sullivan is a show-off, and eager for an aggressive combat style in order to receive promotions, medals and praises. Some of the other men in the platoon are Danny Kolowicz, Sgt. Lemchek, Pfc. George 'Ike' Eisenhower, Sgt. Tucker, Pvt. Jerry Marconi Whitehouse, Heinrich 'Heinie' Weinburger and Lt. Rawson himself. Sgt. Sullivan is mercilessly pushing his men to their limit, with little rest, praise or empathy. This leadership style attracts the enmity of his men and of the more humane platoon leader, Lt. Rawson. At a river fording, the inadequacy of the American Sherman tank, armed with the 75 mm gun, becomes evident. The lead tank is neutralized by a German 88 mm Flack gun. During one-on-one tank duels with the much heavier, better armored, superior gunned German tanks, the American Shermans fall pray to German shells, while the Shermans' shells bounce-off the German armor. Some men bemoan the situation and dream of better American tanks to give the crews a better chance of survival during fire exchanges with the German monsters. Pfc. Eisenhower even begs a two-star general for better tanks and is promised newer tanks, armed with 90 mm guns and sporting thicker armor. They all take this promise as a joke, meant to humor the men, until, a few months later, the first Pershing tanks start arriving. After liberating a few Belgian towns, the division moves into position to assault the Siegfried Line. The German tank obstacles, including the deadly 'dragon's teeth' and heavy artillery await the American tank units. Sergeant Sullivan's reckless bravery wins them successes but casualties too. Later-on, a major German infantry counter-attack is repulsed by Sullivan's advance smart defensive preparations. The men don't know whether to admire or hate Sullivan's guts. Once over the border, into Germany proper, the men open a bottle of champagne to celebrate the event. When they reach a major German town, Pfc. Heinrich 'Heinie' Weinburger, a German-American, starts asking strange questions, in German, of the numerous German POW's being herded and processed by the American soldiers. When Weinburger wanders-off into the city, a suspicious Sullivan follows him around and discovers Weinburger's painful secret. Finally, a promotion to Lieutenant, arrives for Sullivan but it also means the mandatory re-assignment to another unit. Emotionally attached to his men and his platoon, Sullivan refuses the promotion, choosing to remain a sergeant with his outfit instead.",,0.0209611661166117,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-tanks-are-coming_1951_44106.csv

Bella's delicate constitution takes a turn for the worse after moving into the house, she forgetting and misplacing things, as well as being delusional in hearing noises in the closed off upper floors of the house, and seeing the lights flicker when no one else is in the house, those flickers which should only occur when other lights are turned on and off in the house in the gas to the lights being dispersed. Paul's love for her crosses that fine line into hate in dealing with Bella's worsening mental health, he isolating her in the house in not wanting to be embarrassed by her in public. Paul's harsh treatment exacerbates the situation as Bella teeters on the brink of madness. However, B.G. Rough, the livery stable owner who was once a police constable who worked on the Barlow case, believes Paul Mallen not the person he says he is and is really someone indirectly associated to the Barlow case. With the help of Bella's cousin Vincent Ullswater, who has always been at odds with Paul, who in turn has refused to let him see Bella without her knowledge, Rough may uncover what is happening behind the locked doors of 12 Pimlico Square.

When he and his passengers, Bill Summers and his black valet, Jefferson Jackson, hear a lone transmission in a foreign language, they crash land the plane on the island below. The lost men discover themselves in a graveyard, and follow the sound of drums to a nearby mansion. There they are greeted by Viennese Dr. Sangre, who treats Mac's minor head wound with the warning that untreated injuries are easy prey for evil spirits. Sangre says there are no radios on the island and allows the men to spend the night as his guests, although he insists that Jeff stay in the servants quarters in the basement. Jeff becomes alarmed when the maid, Samantha, and the cook, Tahama, call forth two ""zombies,"" but when he runs upstairs to tell his boss, Sangre dismisses the idea as ludicrous. Sangre's wife Alyce also appears to be in a trance-like state, which Sangre attributes to jungle fever. Sangre appears surprised when Bill tells him about American Admiral Wainwright, whose plane disappeared in the same location. Sangre then tells the men that no one in his family, which includes his beautiful niece, Barbara Winslow, can leave the island because they are Austrian refugees lacking passports. Later that night, Jeff confides in Samantha that Bill is a government agent on a secret mission. Sangre's butler, Momba, Samantha and Tahama leave Jeff alone in the kitchen just before midnight, with the admonition not to pay notice to anything unusual. When two zombies nearly attack Jeff, he runs to Bill and Mac's room for safety. Jeff is later awakened by the appearance of a woman who seems to come and go through a wall, and when he awakens Bill and Mac, they believe him only after finding an earring. The three men split up to search the house, and Bill finds Barbara in the library reading a book on hypnotism. Barbara says that she is reading the book to help her aunt, who has been in the trance-like state since arriving at the island, and Bill confides his belief that Sangre is hiding a radio. Bill and Mac finally believe Jeff's stories about zombies after Mac is attacked by one. The next morning, Mac and Bill discover a freshly dug grave in the cemetery, and that someone has stolen the plane's radio. Mac goes in search of a generator, while Bill returns to the house, unaware that the admiral is being held hostage in a cellar and that Tahama is trying to pry military secrets from him with the use of voodoo. After Sangre calls in a report to his German allies, Mac disappears. Sangre then lures Jeff into the cellar, where he hypnotizes him into believing that he is a zombie. While Bill is searching for Mac, he finds Barbara using hypnotism on her aunt, and assumes that she is collaborating with Sangre, despite her protests that she is trying to restore her aunt's memory. Mac returns in a zombie-like state, and a physician called by Sangre says that he has been dead for hours. When Momba receives orders by radio for Sangre to transmit the stolen military information, he and Tahama prepare a special ceremony to wrest the information from the admiral. Jeff lines up with the other zombies for dinner, but Samantha breaks his spell. Jeff then meets with Bill and moments later, they hear a woman's scream and find Alyce dead. Bill and Jeff follow the sound of drums into the cellar, where Sangre is holding a ceremony during which the admiral's thoughts are to be transmitted into Barbara's brain. Bill breaks up the ceremony and when Sangre orders the zombies to attack Bill, they instead follow Mac, and turn on Sangre. Sangre shoots Mac and, while backing away from the zombies, falls to his death into a firepit. After Wainwright phones the Coast Guard, and Mac's injuries are treated, Wainwright tells Bill that Sangre forced his plane to land with a false radio signal, then killed his crew and tortured him for Canal Zone fortification plans. When his torture did not work, he used Alyce and Barbara as test subjects with other methods.",,,

Coyle as the co-director and ""Pre-Production Scenes Directed and Produced by Norman Dawn"" - in addition to showing the following animals ""credited"" below the human cast (showing here to complete the casting order for fans of animal performers, since the IMDb does not give animal credits) the following were given cast credits below the 12th billed Nina Campana; Swift Lightning - half dog & half wolf (13), Firefly, a collie (14), Buck, a St. Bernard (15) (and about the 5th film Buck, from ""Call of the Wild"", had poster and film credits), Toughie and Roughie, two bear cubs (15 & 16) and Winkey, the Talking raven (17.) The film finds writer Jean Williams coming to a Eskimo settlement, Topek village, in search of material for a novel. The locals fear ""Swift Lightning"", a half dog-half wolf that leads a vicious wolf pack. To escape the merciless winter and the wolf pack, the entire village leaves on a boat brought there by the local white trader, Hugo. He, in love with Jean, vainly attempts to persuade her to leave also. The only other person that stays is trapper Gaston Rogers. The plot comes to a grinding halt for a while showing Jean playing with her other companions, Firefly, Winkey and two bear cubs. Swift Lightning comes to the village prowling for food, finds love instead with Firefly, the Collie, and they depart for the hills. Conditions worsen and Jean and Gaston are forced to leave, but she insists they go by way of Nenana to see the gigantic yearly ice-break, which is somewhat akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but they had all this footage shot by Norman Dawn which would have gone to waste otherwise. As expected, in such situations, the ice breaks earlier than usual, and Jean and Gaston are caught in the flow, losing their dogs and sled. A wandering trapper finds Gaston's sled, and Hugo sends a search plane from Nenana, and instructions are dropped telling of a deserted cabin nearby. Jean and Gaston find the cabin, and so does Swift Lightning and Firefly. And Hugo and his St. Bernard, Buck also show up. A double triangle of love problems soon develops between the humans (Jean, Hugo and Gaston) and the animals (Swift Lightning, Firefly and Buck), with Hugo and Buck the early betting-line favorites but one would do better to take the odds and bet on Gaston and Swift Lightning, or go back and check on which human and which animal was billed above the others.",,0.0322195608782435,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/call-of-the-yukon_1938_29961.csv

Salter,Ellsworth Fredericks,"A bottle of Scotch carried by WW2 veteran Captain Sam MacKenzie of the U.S. Marine Corps provides the 'glue' that keeps this story together. Its value rests squarely in its symbolism - a good-luck charm and an object of hope, as well as loyalty. The bottle of Scotch itself was received by Sam MacKenzie in 1942, during a furlough home from the Pacific War. It was supposed to be enjoyed by Sam and his fiancee, Anne but was saved by the two of them for a happy reunion after the war. It's now 1950, at the outset of the Korean War and Captain Sam MacKenzie, commander of the Easy Company, still carries his Scotch bottle with him, as a good-luck charm. The story-line flashes-back to several instances when Sam almost opened his Scotch bottle. During the savage fighting in winter-frozen Korean Peninsula, Sam has to keep his company together while the enemy harasses the United Nations forces during a temporary retreat. At numerous times, Sam is tempted to open his Scotch bottle to either alleviate the suffering of his wounded men or to drown his own sorrow. He resists these attempts, promising himself and his men to open the bottle when they will all reach the safety of their own lines. During one of the brutal skirmishes with Communist foes, Sam is severely wounded. The medical evacuation helicopter arrives to ferry-out the wounded, including Sam. He leaves his precious Scotch bottle behind, with his men to use whenever they feel downtrodden and in need of a stiff drink. His men, led by the company sergeant, finally reach friendly lines and are evacuated by truck with the neighboring company. While on the evacuation trucks , the men from Sam's company muse whether they should finally open the Scotch bottle and enjoy a drink. Realising that it was the promise of a drink from that bottle that kept their morale up during the worst battles, they all refuse to open it. The men decide to save it, as a thing that brought them good-luck, for their wounded company commander, Captain Sam MacKenzie.",,0.0229635844748858,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/hold-back-the-night_1956_49319.csv

Apart from Zaroff's servant Ivan, the only other people present are Eve Trowbridge and her brother Martin, also survivors of their own shipwreck. Other survivors are missing, however, and Rainsford soon learns why. Zaroff releases them into his jungle island and then hunts them down in his grisly outdoor chess game. Then after Martin disappears Bob realizes that he and Eve are to be the next pawns in Zaroff's deadly game.",,0.0169135523613963,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-most-dangerous-game_1932_23238.csv

Later, while investigating the crime scene, police captain Breen discovers Lamont Granston, whose secret identity is The Shadow, nosing around the safe, and Lamont succeeds in fooling Breen into believing that he is Randall. As they are about to leave, Lamont answers Randall's phone and poses as the absent attorney. The caller, old millionaire Caleb Delthern, wants Randall to come immediately to help him re-write his will. Breen, overhearing the conversation, insists that Lamont go to his client. Upon his arrival, Lamont is instructed by Caleb to omit his niece Marcia from the will because he does not approve of her plans to marry Warren Berranger. Soon after ordering his niece's disinheritance, Caleb is shot and killed by a bullet shot through an open window. When the police arrive, they arrest Winstead Comstock, Marcia's cousin and the designated heir to Caleb's millions, who was seen walking in the garden. They release him, however, when they realize that there is not enough evidence to charge him. After the police and Lamont leave, Marcia's brother Jasper comes home drunk, after having lost a great sum of money at Brossett's gambling house. Brossett, aware of Jasper's bad credit, has threatened to kill him if he does not pay his gambling debts soon. Jasper desperately tries to borrow money from Winstead, and when he refuses the loan Jasper becomes angry and picks up a gun. At that moment Winstead is shot dead. Although it appears as if Jasper killed Winstead, the authorities later prove that the bullet that killed Winstead came from another gun. Warren, meanwhile, begins to suspect that Lamont is a fraud and soon finds out that the real Randall is out of town. Hoping to learn more about Brossett, Lamont poses as Randall's assistant, bugs Brossett's office and subsequently learns that Brossett has been planning to acquire Jasper's portion of the Delthern estate. At the Delthern house, Brossett's thugs hold up Marcia, Winstead's brother Humphrey and Warren, and demand that they give them Caleb's will, until Lamont, in his Shadow disguise, rescues them and foils Brossett's plan. When Brossett and his cohort, Wellington, show up at Lamont's home, intent on killing him, Lamont manages to create a distraction that results in Brossett and Wellington shooting each other. Before dying, Wellington confesses that he is Warren's father and that he killed Caleb and Winstead so that his son and Marcia would inherit Caleb's money and have a better life. Later, Lamont meets the real Randall, who forgives Lamont for impersonating him when he learns that he solved an important mystery.",,0.0263598717948718,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-shadow-strikes_1937_29542.csv

Hirliman",Hugo Riesenfeld,Mack Stengler,"First of all this film was produced and distributed in 1938, and is not a 1941 production. The exhibitors and various censor boards objected to the original title, ""The Sunset Strip Case"" (because of the double meaning that implied a strip on Sunset rather than the name of the street, which is exactly what the producer had in mind when he hired fan-dancer Sally Rand, the hit of the Chicago Exposition and the later Texas Centennial), and Boston promptly banned the film, as Boston was often subject to do with far less reason than they had with this film. The film was tied up in law suits across the country brought against the various blue-nose boards who also blocked its showing, and all this was going on during the collapse of Grand National with GN president E. W. Hammons being hauled to court by exhibitors and creditors, including the production unit headed by this film's producer George A. Hirliman. The latter produced it for Grand National distribution, but Grand National had no distribution left when Hirliman finally got it cleared for showing in New York in 1941 under the title of ""The Sunset Murder Case""...and it was distribued through indie exchanges in 1941 as Grand National had long folded its tent. It still carried the Grand National logo, which evidently has fooled the source that keeps calling this a 1941 production, and showing it as being distributed by an entity that no longer existed. The cast order shown on the 1941 prints is no way reflective of the cast order shown on original release. Excuse the use of Plot Summary to explain why this is not a 1941 film, but that is beginning to appear to be the only way to get this film into its proper decade. The plot summary, albeit skimpy,already on site will suffice for the plot. Be advised that Sally Rand was slower with her fans and showed more flesh in a later-Soundies short film than she does here. This one ran into trouble in 1938 because of her name, and not what she actually showed, although she showed more than was custom in 1938...or 1948 or 1958 for that matter.",,0.0194820110701107,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/sunset-murder-case_1938_34244.csv

In therapy, Dr. Judd, the psychiatrist, learns that she also believes, out of that villagers' tale, that she has descended from this evil - women who change into great cats like panthers in passion, anger or jealousy - and that she will turn into a such a dangerous big cat upon being kissed in turn killing her lover and others who have betrayed her. This belief is why she has resisted falling in love before she met Oliver. Learning this information from Irena, Oliver wants to do whatever needed to help her as does Dr. Judd.

Nicky's sentence is predicated on him living at the run down Kentucky horse farm of his Aunt Henrietta and Uncle Jed Bruce, who he hasn't seen since he was a child. The judge figured this more wholesome environment would get Nicky away from his bad influences. Henrietta wants to be a part of Nicky's salvation, but Jed doesn't trust the fact of a delinquent being under his roof, although he has other more personal reasons not having to do with Nicky for his initially antagonistic relationship with his nephew. Nicky doesn't rebel against farm life, but ends up gravitating toward anything mechanical, especially the sports car owned by sophisticated Fran Templeton - the elder daughter of Dan Templeton, who owns the luxurious neighboring horse farm - and by association Fran herself. With his infatuation with Fran, Nicky doesn't see that Fran's younger sister, the tomboyish and horse loving Liz Templeton, hangs around him because she is falling for him. It isn't until a couple of incidents involving Jed's only remaining horse, the spirited Tugfire, occur that Nicky begins to see his uncle and Liz in a different light.

Baker was now odd-man-out at the studio as his contract had been with Trem Carr, and Carr and associate Malvern had moved over to Monogram to begin a series of four ""Tailspin Tommy"" features. Universal, usually late to the party anyway, added Baker and comedian Fuzzy Knight to the first-six Brown films to form a trio angle along the lines of Republic's highly successful ""Three Mesquiteers"" series, but there were no continuing roles in these films---they even killed Baker off in the 2nd film---and Baker's 2nd-lead soon went to 3rd-lead (behind Knight) and then to ""gone"" after the sixth film. When Bob Baker was next seen in a film at Universal, it was as the uncredited bus driver in Abbott and Costello's ""Ride 'Em Cowboy"" in 1942. From this point onward, Fuzzy Knight was the sidekick in every B-series western made by Universal until they closed shop on series westerns and serial production when they merged with International Pictures to become Universal-International: In this one, Steve Hayden, working undercover, comes to Denton to help restore law and order. The men secretly responsible for the lawlessness are Big Bill Tanner and Melenkthy Culp, the town banker. (A pairing made in filmdom heaven since the meaner and more desperate the two become, the more enjoyable they are to watch.) Judith Lantry arrives from back east to check on her ranch holdings ran by her cousin Bill ""Cousin Willie"" Strong, and Tanner and Culp, fearful she will discover the faked mortgages they put on her property, send henchman Ortega to do away with her, but Steve saves her life. She and Cousin Willie put Steve in charge of the ranch, and he quickly fires her crooked foreman Lon, and hires Clem Waters and a whole new group of cowhands. Steve captures Lon with 200 head of horses belong to Judith, and he confesses and implicates Tanner and Culp.",,0.0242445833333333,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/desperate-trails_1939_31224.csv

Led by the murderous Ash, the hired guns of Stiles kill Clayborn and his wife but their young son John survives and joins his grandfather in Austin. As the boy grows into a man he learns the use of a law book as well as a six gun, intending to use both to bring Stiles to justice. As lawyer John Clay, he travels to the Cottonwood headquarters of Stiles, self-proclaimed King of the Pecos, and meets Hank Matthews and Josh Billings, two cattlemen thrown into poverty through the crooked dealings of Stiles. John serves a summons for Stiles to appear in court but the circuit judge is too frightened to face the might of Stiles. John sends Hank to round up other impoverished cattlemen, and they provide the judge with an armed escort to Cottonwood. The judge upholds the ranchers' pleas for use of water and grass, and Stiles sees most of his ill-gotten gains turned over to public domain for proper filing. Stiles convinces newcomers Eli Jackson and his daughter Belle that John is trying to cheat the ranchers and file claims for himself. He also plans an ambush for those riding through the canyon to file claims and he sends Ash and his gunmen to the hills, instructing them to shoot anyone without the white arm bands he has supplied to his own riders. John discovers the plot and has the ranchers to also wear white arm bands, ensuring their safe passage. With their claim successfully filed the ranchers plan a cattle drive to Abilene where the railroad is promising $20 a head. Stiles steals whatever cattle he can and moves his outlaws to Sweetwater, where he hopes to extort money for use of the water there from the trail drivers. When the drive reaches Sweetwater, John confronts Stiles, revealing that he is the son of the murdered Clayborn's and that Sweetwater rightfully belongs to him. Following a siege by John and the ranchers, Stiles tries to escape by buckboard, but when the wagon tips over he is crushed by the safe containing money he has stolen from others. John pursues Ash into the rocks, offering him a chance to draw first and then ills him. John leaves his gun and his quest for revenge at the site and turns his mind to Belle and his law career.",,0.0212046941678521,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/king-of-the-pecos_1936_27849.csv

After saloon owner Mark Flemming, who wants to buy the ranch from owner Mary Scott, assures Spud that his men will help with the lynching, Spud tells Bob that the lynch mob is a scheme to help him escape. Spud plans to tie Bob's hands loosely and leave guns hidden under the saddle flaps on ""Rocky,"" Bob's horse. Not trusting Spud, Flemming keeps him in his office during the breakout, but Bob escapes from the mob anyway and rides Rocky to safety. Later, as Mary, who is anxious to go East to become a singer, signs the deed over to Flemming, Bob and Spud interrupt. After Spud manages to swipe the deed from Flemming's pocket, Bob vows to find out what is on the ranch that Flemming wants. The next day, when Flemming, who has gone to the county seat to have the deed recorded, discovers it missing, he swears out a warrant for Mary's arrest, and when her stage stops at another town, she is apprehended. Extremely angered, Mary now refuses to sign a second deed and insists on staying in jail. Bob and Spud fail to find evidence of oil or gold on the ranch, but they overhear a stranger tell Flemming's men that the ""stuff"" runs rich on the land. When the stranger refuses to identify the nature of the stuff, Bob and Spud subdue Flemming's men in a fight; however, Flemming's foreman, Buck Mason, gets Spud's gun and orders Bob and Spud to leave. Bob searches Flemming's house but finds nothing. He then offers to strike a deal with Flemming for the deed, but a fight begins, and Flemming's men subdue Bob and Spud and tie their hands. Bob, however, manages to throw some bullets into the fire, and when they explode, Flemming and his men leave in fright. A small fire starts on the carpet, and Bob realizes that potash, which Flemming and his men have tracked in, has caught on fire and must be the reason Flemming desires the ranch, as potash is used in fertilizer and explosives, among other things. Meanwhile Flemming apologizes to Mary and, after convincing her that he does not want the ranch, tricks her into signing a second deed, so that she can get rid of it and go East. Bob hears about this and, after fighting Flemming's men and townspeople in the saloon, chases Flemming, who is on his way to have the deed recorded. He tackles Flemming and takes him to jail, where Flemming signs a confession clearing Bob of the rustling charges.

To find Reynolds in the gold towns, he systematically stops stagecoaches and goes through the mail, hoping to find letters addressed to Reynolds and thusly learn his whereabouts. Thus ""The Kid"" earns the reputation of a stagecoach robber, although he never takes anything, and the reputation is enhanced by the fact that he travels with Laramie (Francis McDonald), a notorious half-breed outlaw. A posse is about to capture them and Roy rides back to get Laramie whose horse has been shot, and Laramie repays the favor by slugging Roy and escaping on his horse Trigger. The posse rides by the unseen Roy and captures Laramie and, since he is riding the ""Kid's"" horse, take him to jail as being the ""Kid."" Laramie denies this and is told he will be free when he identifies the ""Kid""; othewise he will hang. Roy rides into town, having deduced that the Morgan Reynolds he is looking for operates the Yellowback Saloon under the alias of ""Lee Jessup"" (Bob Steele) . As part of his plan to get evidence against Jessup, who also does not know his true identity, Roy takes a job as saloon shotgun guard, and meets saloon singer Joby Madison (Pauline Moore, in one of the truly great performances found in the B-western genre) and falls in love with her. This doesn't set well with Jessup, as he has plans of his own regarding Joby. Young gold miner Scott Warren (Noah Beery, Jr.), having hit his strike and heading for home with his fortune, comes into the Yellowback, talks too much about his stake, and is soon relieved of it in a crooked poker game by Jessup and friends. Scott, realizing he had been cheated, breaks into Jessup's office and, announcing he is the Carson City Kid, holds up Jessup henchman Harmon (Hal Taliaferro) and takes his gold and some letters and papers from the safe. Captured, he is taken before Laramie, who quickly identifies him as the ""Kid"" although he has never seen him before, in order to win the immunity promised him. Roy, masked as the Carson City Kid and speaking Spanish as the Kid did on the stage holdups, intervenes and at gunpoint, asks Jessup to identify what Scott has stolen from him. Besides the gold, Jessup unwittingly identifies as his own the latters and documents, which establish him as Morgan Reynolds. Reynolds meets justice and Roy is exonerated. ne fine little B-western with an excellent performance by George ""Gabby"" Hayes (as Sheriff Gabby Whittaker), before he had the character down as a sleep-walking exercise and was still revolving, and by, as mentioned, Pauline Moore, as a no-excuses heroine for being where she was doing what she did as a saloon entertainer.",,0.0271344059405941,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/the-carson-city-kid_1940_32312.csv

When the rustlers steal a herd from Alice Blake, her kid brother Bobbie, sets out to get help from his radio favorites, Roy Rogers, King of the Cowboys, and the Sons of the Pioneers, who are en route to Lariat Lodge to play a one-night stand. While riding down the road with Gabby Whittaker, who has given him a ride in his jalopy, Bobbie sees three men who he recognizes as rustlers and, when he tries to stop them, they begin beating him with whips. His life is saved by the timely arrival of Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers. On the way to take Bobbie back to his sister, who is at the Fellows Ranch, they run into the rustlers on a raid, and take Burt Wooster and Pete prisoners. Wooster, the foreman at the Fellows Ranch, is actually an accomplice working for Jordan. He insists that he is not a gang member and Roy, pretending to believe him, agrees to let him take Pete to Sheriff Brite. Unaware that Roy and the Sons are following, Wooster and Pete go straight to the Lariat Lodge, where Wooster, after announcing that he is quitting, soon learns that he should have gone to the Sheriff with Pete, because Jordan and Pete shoot him.

The selfish young couple agree that even if they spend ten years in prison, it will not matter because they will have the money when they are released. During what appears to be a normal transaction, Jimmy gives Ruth $100,000 that he has taken from the vault, and after they hide the money in a music box, which they mail to Ruth's Uncle Billy for safekeeping, they turn themselves in. Mike Roberts, a detective for the bank's insurance company, tries to convince them to lighten their sentence by returning the money, but they consider the money rightfully theirs and refuse. The judge hearing their case is dismayed by their lack of repentance, and sentences them to one-to-ten years without parole. Jimmy and Ruth are then sent to separate prisons, but communicate by notes. Jimmy's tough cellmate, Blackie Clayton, tries to find out where the money is hidden, but Jimmy gives him misleading information. Sometime later, Roberts arranges for Jimmy and Ruth's paroles and attaches special stipulations that he hopes will make them go straight. The couple are paroled under the conditions that they have no civil rights and cannot marry for eight years. They are crushed by the conditions, but will not give in when Roberts tells them they will be free if they return the money. They try to retrieve the music box from Uncle Billy, but they discover that he has died and that his possessions are to be auctioned. They go to the auction, where they are outbid by auction aficionado Victor J. Holbrook, after which they go to Holbrook's apartment and explain that they need the box.

After dinner, Roberts, alerted by Ira, shows up to warn Jimmy and Ruth that Blackie is close on their trail. Later that night, Blackie threatens Ruth that he will kill Jimmy unless she gives him the money. Jimmy and Ruth attempt to elude Blackie, but he soon catches up with them and fights with Jimmy.

Indeed, many in the audience at one burlesque show in New York have only sex on their minds, including young unmarried couple James and Jane, office colleagues Peggy and Betty (Peggy is trying to seduce Betty), and Paul Lorenz's own son Tom, who is anticipating an aftershow group-sex party that will include some of the girls from the show, such as Sheila Wayne, who has syphilis but treats it as casually as her sexual encounters. Her fellow showgirl Millicent Hamilton will not be at the party. Millicent was once a small-town girl who was planning to marry her beau, Wendel Hope, until she won a beauty contest. Her prize was a trip to New York, but she found life there more difficult than she expected, and a sexual encounter associated with trying to advance her show-business career resulted in her also contracting syphilis. Respected Dr. Hampton informs her that she can fully recover and eventually marry Wendel if she takes the slow and intensive but proven therapy, but when she leaves New York for home--which means therapy with another doctor--Dr. Hampton warns her to beware of quacks who might promise expensive miracle cures. Will she heed Dr. Hampton's advice, or will she fall prey to the hope of a quick cure so that she can marry Wendel sooner?",,0.0209446215139442,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/sex-madness_1938_147467.csv

Newspaper reporters Jean Monroe, drama editor, and Frank Gordon, accompanied by a dumb photographer, Elmer are on the story. Jean receives a note from Ted Wallington, the star of the play,""Satan's Bride"", to meet him. From him, she learns the note was a fake, the lights go out and the Fiend strikes again as Wallington slumps to the floor dead. Peter Fortune, the author of the show, who has helped the police solve previous cases, agrees to assist on this case, but insists on working alone. Jean and Frank have taken rooms at the Globe Hotel, where Reardon, an actor, is also a resident. A telephone message for Frank turns out to be a ruse in the hopes of getting him out of the hotel. Reardon suggests calling the police but, while phoning, his finger is holding the receiver hook down. Meanwhile, Elmer calls Frank and the reporter is dumbfounded to hear his phone ring while Reardon is apparently talking to Police Captain Davis. A fight ensues and Reardon escapes. This gives the hunchbacked terror a chance to slip in the room to make another attempt on Jean's life, but the shot misses. Fortune has some pictures of Reardon donning the Fiend's flowing robe, and Reardon is taken into custody. During an re-enactment of the Wallington murder, Reardon is killed and another theory is exploded. Frank discovers a cigarette case, belonging to Fortune, and his investigation reveals the Fortune's brother had been killed in a fire in a theatre owned by Cooke and Baker, the producers of the show.",,0.0330837398373984,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/a-face-in-the-fog_1936_144191.csv

The movie itself is a salacious plunge into a world of sordid pleasures. It tells us the story of Dr. William G. Davies, an infamous snake-oil salesman who started his career as a promising medical student. In the opening sequence he saves an unborn baby by performing a cesarean operation after the mother was killed in an automobile accident. Stock medical footage shows a woman's stomach being sliced open like a ripe watermelon and the baby popping out like a jack-in-a-box. But the allure of opium proves too strong for the doctor to resist. After a single night of relaxation in a Chinatown opium den, Davies becomes a slave to drugs. As his medical practice deteriorates, he shifts his attention to ""selling medicine by demonstration."" He says to his nurse/fiancee, ""I can't see anything wrong if my preparation has merit."" However, his ""preparation"" is one of the great quack cure-alls: ""Tiger-Fat."" Davies soon becomes one of the leading sideshow attractions for a carnival. His success as a carnival huckster initially allows him to run with a fast crowd. In the movie's most shocking episode, Davies and his ritzy friends retire to a hotel room together for a drug party. ""We're gonna get lit,"" says a woman. A buffet of drugs is spread out on a table and each guest takes their drug of choice. ""It takes a needle for me to get a bang,"" says a woman. As each participant indulges, the party quickly turns into an orgy of excesses, one woman hikes up her skirts, another laughs hysterically, a man pontificates, another man becomes paranoid. The movie provides a litany of different reactions to drugs. Ultimately, Davies' drug addiction leaves him gaunt and stooped, living in a hovel with no hope of returning to his previous life.",,0.0401699159663866,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/narcotic_1933_121587.csv

She figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy. Paine strikes her when she refuses to play along. The chivalrous Morrison intervenes but Paine knocks him out cold. That seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. Soon Dixon has fallen in love with Morgan - but not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up. Morgan's father, a tale-spinning taxi driver, may take the rap for it. It's up to Dixon to try to pin the blame on Scalise.",,0.0456432325886991,/home/amos/drive/datasets/film_csvs/faces/where-the-sidewalk-ends_1950_43132.csv
